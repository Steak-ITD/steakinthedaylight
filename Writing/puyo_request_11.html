                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Requested by the guest Raven, Dark Sig subdues Red Amitie. It is a little light on the bdsm.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Amitie felt like a fool. She may have found new power, but she was still inexperienced with it. And she was still the same clumsy girl deep inside. So she wasn't able to get away when Sig, with his own dark power, subdued her. He didn't seem that much more used to it, but he had the patience that she lack.</p>

                    <p>She was held down on her knees by shadowy vines. Her staff had been kicked away, not that she could have grabbed it with her hands tied. Sig walked up to her, and she gulped, but looked up at him, trying not to show any fear. His face was as plain as always, and she didn't know what he could be thinking. He wouldn't really hurt her, right?</p>
                    
                    <p>One of his clawed hands reached for her face, towards her cheek. He rubbed it softly, then put his thumb in her mouth, coaxing it open. Amitie was confused at first, but her heart raced when she saw him fiddle with his pants, slowly pulling it down and revealing himself. She could figure out what he wanted, and it worried her more. "Wait," Amitie said, trying to look him in the eyes.</p>
                    
                    <p>"No more waiting," he replied smoothly, moving his member closer to her mouth, keeping it open as she began to struggle. "I waited long enough for this." He forced her mouth open wider and pushed inside, and exhaled after feeling her wet tongue.</p>
                    
                    <p>Amitie tried to pull her head back, but now both of Sig's hands were on the back of her head, keeping her still as he slowly thrust inside. Then she tried pushing him out with her tongue, but that only made him feel better, and she ended up swallowing his pre come. She heard him pant above, watching her give up struggling. Amitie herself moaned, then immediately questioned why. This wasn't something she wanted, she thought. Yet there was still a bubbling feeling down below.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before she knew it, Sig pulled out of her mouth with a wet pop, and the he moaned as well. His cum spirts onto her face. It felt warm, but made Amitie shiver. With what, she couldn't tell.</p>
                    
                    <p>They looked at each other again. Sig was blushing and breathing heavily. "So pretty," he whispered. Amitie felt her own face become red.</p>
                    
                    <p>The vines holding her began to shift, pulling her on her feet. They seperated her legs, but kept her hands tied. Sig approached her again, his claws going for her white coat. He opened it slowly, painfully so. Amitie wished he would have done it faster, not draw out this anticipation. She heard her breath hitch when his hands touched her breasts, hidden away by her training bra.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Sig, please, don't..." He ignored her plea and started ripping open the bra. It fell away, and finally his hands were on her bare skin. They were small, still growing, but there was still enough for him to squeeze, drawing a gasp from the girl. He played with the mounds, ocassionally passing his fingers over her nipples. He realized how that made her jump, and began to pay more attention to them.</p>
                    
                    <p>Amitie tried again to ask him to stop, but her voice was caught when he pinched her nipple, making her yell out in pain... Well, not quite pain, as she found that the tension building in her wasn't exactly hurting. But it was still tense. She couldn't quite tell what she wanted.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sig was very close to her now. She could see he was hard again, feeling his member touch her belly. She couldn't keep her eyes up, watching him continue to play with her nipples. This... wasn't so bad, she thought. It even felt good, and that should have scared her. But somehow it didn't, it made her more curious than anything. Curious about her feelings, and Sig's.</p>
                    
                    <p>She noticed almost immediately when his hands moved away from her. She let out a whine, of all things. That caused their eyes to meet yet again, for just a second. "W-why did you stop?" she asked.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sig hummed quizzically. "You wanted me to, didn't you?"</p>
                    
                    <p>"I... I don't know," she panted. She did want it to stop at first, but now, this feeling had built up inside her too much. She needed some kind of relief, a release of this tension. "It felt good, I just want to feel good."</p>
                    
                    <p>The boy smiled, coming up to her and hugging her half naked body. "Me too," he cooed into her ear, giving her that shiver again. He moved a hand down to her pants, pulling them down. He felt the heat of her lower lips on his cock. It was so enticing. The two moan in unison as he pushes in between them.</p>
                    
                    <p>They slide together beautifully, Amitie's wetness making it feel so much better. She squeezes her legs together, wanting to feel him as much as possible. He thrusts between her legs at a steady pace, hugging her close as tight as he can while still being able to move.</p>
                    
                    <p>And that tension Amitie feels, it becomes tighter and tighter, but also feel better and better. She imagines Sig must have feot something similar too, as his movement becomes more sporadic. Finally the tightness breaks like a rubber band, and she feels loose, as if she were no longer restrained. Her breaths become high pitched whines. Sig feels it too, her legs squeezing him tighter. He doesn't stop thrusting as he comes again, harder than before.</p>
                    
                    <p>The two keep standing there, basking in each other. Once she becomes grounded, Amitie wonders. Just a moment ago she had struggled to be free, but now she felt comfortable in this position. She was still confused about how this all came about, but chose to let it be for now. She could ask someone else who knew more later.</p>
