                    <hr>
                    <p>"Fairy Fair!" Amitie screams in desperation to chase away her once friend. He continues approaching unphased, muttering another spell. It pierces through her own, then continues to hit her, pushing her to the ground. Before she can get up, the demon is standing over her, red eyes aglow.</p>

                    <p>"Sig, please stop. This isn't you!" she cries out. He leans down toward her, a gentle, cruel smile on his face.</p>
                    
                    <p>"It is," he says. "It's who I was always meant to be." His claw caresses Amitie's face as he watches her cry. His other hand moves to her throat and begins to squeeze tightly. She chokes and struggles, but a dark blue magic is emitting from his hands, and she feels weaker and weaker. Her vision is becoming dotted, and her head hurts.</p>
                    
                    <p>Why had this happened? She knew she was right. This wasn't her friend. It couldn't be. She tried to reach her hand out to him, to beg, do anything. It was becoming too much for her.</p>
                    
                    <p>He lifted the girl up by her throat. "You look beautiful, defeated like this." That was the last thing she heard as her mind began to fade, and she fell into unconsciousness.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Something happens to Black Sig that causes him to embrace his demon side in the worst way possible. Maybe his estranged evil parents find him. Maybe his caretakers are gone (Akuma and Lemres in this AU). Maybe the sealed demon gets to him. Maybe ALL of those things. Don't worry about it. Or do. As for me, just wanted to think about the idea of an evil Sig, power hungry and fully violent.</p>
