                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> I think Deirdre x Seliph could be really sweet... Well, he is a young boy in this fic, and the modern setting is mainly for lighting from the TV. This is a written version of a short comic I plan to eventually finish drawing.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The night was calm, quiet, and so far uneventful. Deirdre sat on the couch with her little boy Seliph. A movie played on the tv, covering the room in a blue light. It was one Deirdre had seen before, but Seliph was completely engrossed in it.</p>

<p>Until something scary and loud popped up on screen, startling the boy. He gasped and quickly jumped into his mother's lap, startling her as well. She realized what happened and held him closer, giving him calming words. As she pat his head, he looked up at her, the slightest tears forming in his eyes, giving them an innocent shine.</p>

<p>He looked so sweet, so precious. Deirdre's heart flutters. She holds her son a little tighter, and gulps. He wanted more comfort, and she would be... happy to oblige.</p>

<p>As the light in the room shifts, so too does she, leaning down to plant small kisses on Seliph's head. He giggled, and she looked away shyly. This was fine, she thought. Simple, chaste kisses were enough to reign in her feelings.</p>

<p>And that was all it was meant to be. But she was startled again when suddenly, Seliph quickly moves his hands around her neck, and his head upwards, and his lips meet hers. Her eyes widen at the motion, and at the sensation.</p>

<p>She should move away, she thought. This was getting into unseemly territory.</p>

<p>And yet, the way her body reacted was strong. Her heart didn't just flutter, no, for just a second, it seemed to stop altogether.</p>

<p>In another second, her eyes closed. Another, and she was leaning in, returning her son's affection in a way that could no longer be described as chaste. Their kiss was deep and warm, matching the television's now orange light.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed before they separated, a breath between them. As their eyes met, they blushed and smiled at each other lovingly. Seliph then looked away, his arms moving from Deirdre's neck. He turned back towards the tv, feeling a bit sheepish after realization set in.</p>

<p>Deirdre on the other hand felt her inhibitions vanish, feeling a desire to provide more to her dear boy. She sighs and brings her hands to his belly, rubbing softly and slowly moving lower.</p>

<p>She reaches within his pants, and he gasps at her touch. He looks down briefly, but soon his eyes roll back up at the sensation.  She strokes his small member, listening to his short, low moans. His breaths become quicker as he becomes harder. The tip peaks out of his pants, and he turns his head into his mothers chest.</p>

<p>She too lets out a soft moan. Seeing her son like this made her feel a thrill as well, but for now she wanted to focus on him.</p>

<p>Eventually Seliph grunts, shivering and shaking in her grasp. She thought he looked so beautiful in this moment, and she once again gives him words of comfort and calm while he settles down.</p>

<p>He yawns afterward. It was rather late, and the movie had ended some time ago. Deirdre gives him one more kiss on the forehead and holds him in her arms. Then the two lay down on the couch and fall asleep to the low-key music of the television.</p>
