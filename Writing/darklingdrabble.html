                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> I was inspired after creating the Darkling AU to do a double drabble that describes their relationship a bit. I really like how it came out.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p> Sometimes, sig would begin to act out in a certain way. More avaricious, impatient. One might even call it aggressive if they didn't know him. Lem thought it was a part of his demon physiology. He should probably ask Akuma about it sometime. And perhaps even ask himself why he was so willing to indulge this streak of behavior. </p>
<p> Sig's touch was normally gentle and attentive so as to not harm anything with his strength. Now he seemed ready to claw away at lemres with reckless abandon. But he knew how to control himself, how not to go too deep with the scratches on his chest and back. Just enough to whiff the familiar light scent of metal and feel it drip on the tips of his claws. </p>
<p> The two of them lay so close together now. They breathed in unison. Even closer sig leaned to kiss and bite his neck, then lick the droplets of blood. Lem wanted more... He wanted these marks, wanted to be possessed like this. He loved this little demon, and he wished he could make him as happy as possible. </p>
<p>"Mine, " Sig growled into 
Lemres' ear. </p><p>"Yes, Sig, I'm all yours, " he whispered back. </p>
