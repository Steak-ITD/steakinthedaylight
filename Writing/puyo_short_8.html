                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> A reverse age lemsig short. Expressing Lemres' curiosity about things, and growing feelings. It's a bit more outline like though.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"Say, you've got the same boy parts I do, right?" Lemres says one day. "Would it be ok if you... showed me?"</p>
<p>"Hmm?" Sig tilts his head in confusion.</p>
<p>"I-I'll show you mine too, of course! So it would be fair."</p>
<p>Lemres is growing up, starting to become more curious about certain things, like his lower half... he could probably find a book about it, but how would his parents react! They might punish him again. Sig was grown up, too, though. Maybe he knew some things that were on Lemres' mind.</p>
<p>"Well, ok," Sig says, not seeing an issue. He's still one to just go with the flow of events. He begins to remove his pants and underwear, blushing a bit as Lemres stares at him. Lem looks for a bit before realizing he's supposed to be doing the same thing and starts removing his pants, too. Eventually, the two are standing in front of each other pantsless.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's much bigger than mine..." Lemres notices the length and girth of Sig's adult member. "And fluffy too," he also spots the fluff at the top. He had noticed his own pubic area growing some hairs. He wonders if his own would grow to be so big and hairy one day. Then another question crosses his mind.</p>
<p>*Would it grow if I touched it, too?* Lemres had noticed touching himself enough made his member grow harder and a bit longer, so perhaps Sig was the same? He moved his hand to touch it, but Sig stopped him. "Ah, wait."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, have I overstepped?"</p>
<p>"Touching someone else there, it's..."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see..." Of course, it was probably inappropriate to touch somewhere so private without proper permission. Sig's face was getting redder. Lemres hoped he wasn't uncomfortable. "I... I was just wondering... when you touch down here, does it grow?"</p>
<p>"Mhm."</p>
<p>"Could I please see it? If you're ok with it, of course!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, you have to ask first." Slowly, Sig begins to stroke himself, and indeed, his member begins stiffening. Lemres watches in fascination as it becomes harder and longer, noticing something begin to ooze from the tip... his stomach starts to feel warmer, and he clutches it as Sig moans lightly.</p>
<p>"You... like it...?"</p>
<p>Lemres looks confused for a moment before following Sig's eyes to see his own erection! He quickly covers himself, feeling embarrassed. But why? Why does he feel so abashed all of a sudden? And why *did* his member become so hard just by looking at someone else?</p>
<p>"Maybe we should stop," Sig says, his brow furrowed. Lemres nodded, his own face becoming red. They both pull up their pants again.</p>
<p>Lemres still had so many questions about this moment. But he didn't want to make Sig uncomfortable. Perhaps he would have to do research by himself after all, even with the fear of punishment...</p>
<p>Sig, still hard, can't stop thinking about Lemres and his own erection. And when he thinks of him actually touching him, it doesn't seem so bad after all...</p>
