                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> There was this whole head canon of mine where Larry was jealous of Bowser Jr. This story is a culmination of that: he turns himself into a baby to get more attention. It backfires. Written in 2014.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"Wendy! Hey!"<br />
She spins around and glares at Larry. "WHAT, LARRY, WHAT?!!?"<br />
"Why is everyone so obsessed over that whiny thing?" He pointed to Baby Junior.<br />
"You mean, the baby? Well, cause he's a baby. Babies aren't able to take care of themselves."<br />
Junior looked lovingly at Larry and said, "Imma babeh!"<br />
Wendy snuggled him and said, "Yes you are, cutie!"<br />
"Bleugh." Then Larry started thinking. "Hey, Wendy. WENDY! HEY! WEEENDDY!"<br />
"What the shell do you WANT, Larry?!"<br />
"If I were a baby, would you pay more attention to me?"<br />
Wendy was barely paying attention to him as she was changing Junior. "Yeah, sure, whatever. Go bug someone else please? Thank you."<br />
                    <img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" style="width:756px" />
Larry walked over to Iggy's room. He put on one of his fake innocent smiles. "Hi big brother who I luuuv"<br />
But he wasn't clueless. "Sigh, what do you want me to do for you now?"<br />
"Uh... can I see your chemistry stuff?"<br />
"Oh of course! I would totally trust you to handle a bunch of dangerous chemicals!"<br />
"Thanks pal!" Larry started walking toward the bottles, then Iggy pushed him back.<br />
"I was being sarcastic. I don't trust you at all."<br />
Larry became frustrated. "Fine. I won't touch your dumb science things." He began to walk out. And as he did this he planned to just sneak in while Iggy was asleep.<br />
                    <img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" style="width:756px" />
And at about 11:00, that's what he did. He found the bottles, and turned on his flashlight. He found a bottle saying, "Youth".<br />
"Perfect," Larry whispers as he takes the bottle from his shelf. He popped the lid and drank it. Then he waited.<br />
And he waited.<br />
And he waited.<br />
And he still waited.<br />
And he waited.<br />
And then he was tired of waiting.<br />
"Sheesh, this doesn't wo-"<br />
And then there was a loud pop.<br />
It was quite loud and obviously it woke up Iggy, but also Ludwig in the next room.<br />
"What happened?!" Iggy said when he got up. His question was answered when he saw a six month old on the floor.<br />
"Hi big brother!"<br />
"Larry?! What did you do?!"<br />
Larry looked cutely at Iggy. "I'm a baby now, teehee! And since I can't take care of myself everyone will have to pay attention to me!"<br />
"Not quite."<br />
The two spun around to see Ludwig standing behind him. He seemed dazed from being awoken suddenly. "Zat potion only changed your cellular structure to zat of a baby, but not your mental capacity."<br />
"What does THAT mean?"<br />
"It means you only have zee body of an infant, not zee mind. You still have zee intelligence of a six year old, who can take care of himself..."<br />
They heard crying in another room.<br />
"...vereas, Junior doesn't since he was hatched two monss ago."<br />
Larry made a pouting face. "Awwwwww!"<br />
Then Iggy added, "And that potion only lasts for about twelve hours."<br />
"AWWWWW!"<br />
Ludwig picked him up. "But hey, if you really vant to be treated like a baby, zen I can help you vis zat." His face curled into a mischievous smile.<br />
                    <img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" style="width:756px" />
"Hi Junior!"<br />
"Hewo." He looked up with tired eyes.<br />
"Guess vat? You get a bunk mate tonight!" Ludwig placed Larry into the crib. "Goodnight kiddies. Heh, heh." He walked out.<br />
Junior recognized his brother. He looked lovingly at him and squeaked, "Lawwy!" He jumped up and hugged him.<br />
Larry just stared blankly, and murmured, "Well, at least someone's giving me some attention..."</p>
