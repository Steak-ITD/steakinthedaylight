                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Graphic depictions of sexual violence!</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Whoops, I said I would rewrite this in order, but ended up doing the bad end first as I was, once again, in a depressive mood. I feel better having written it now at least. Again this is very violent so be careful.</p>

                    <p>Bark didn't mind cold weather at all. It made sense being a polar bear adapted to such weather, but he also found something peacful in the endless blank expanses of snow. The white contrasted the light of the sky wonderfully, even with the snowstorm starting to brew. Although, viewing this with a warm fire by his side sounded nice too.</p>

<p>His work today took much longer than he would have liked, and his whole body felt sore. He was looking foward to getting some much needed rest in the closest inn he could think of, and basking in that fire he was daydreaming of.</p>

<p>As he passed by a frozen pond, he noticed the edge had some cracks. Briefly wondering if someone fell into the ice, he took a closer look. The cracks were just surface level, but he also noticed the snow around was scuffed. Moved around frantically.</p>

<p>Bark figured there was some kind of fight here. No way to tell how bad it had been, but fights this far from any establishment were easy to overlook. So he went back on his way. There wasn't anything else he could do.</p>

                    <p>When Amy woke up, the first thing she registered was cold. But it was a different kind of cold from the icy fields she remembered just being in. This cold was painful, suffocating. Or perhaps it was the pain from her chest and head that made it feel that much worse. The next thing she registered was that she couldn't see much. It was a very dark room, light only coming from a few small cracks in the wall, and what must have been a door. Maybe she could break through the walls then. She tried moving, only to realize her hands were tied together. She also noticed her feet were chained; pulling at them revealed to the wall.

                        <p>As she finished assessing here surroudings, she heard a noise. The door in front of her opened. Upon seeing who opened it, she became defensive. It was that blue-white bear. The one who had attacked her. Who she wasn't strong enough to beat, or fast enough to run away from.
                        
                            <p>"Hello sweetie. So nice to see you awake." He was grinning ear to ear, and his voice had a faux sweetness to it. Amy didn't give him a response, just glared at him. He walked up to her, then lifted her body up to his eye level, looking her right back in the eyes. Her quills flared as they looked at each other. "Trying to intimidate me? How adorable."
                        
                                <p>She hissed at him, which only made him chuckle. She didn't want to give this bear her diginity as well. But that wouldn't last as his free hand moved to her chest, and she flinched at his touch. Then she cringed as his grip focused around her short. With a swift motion, he tore the seams off the front, letting the back fall off. Amy's breath got just a little faster, which was noticable on her now bare chest. She tried to hide her discomfort as his hand then moved down to her skirt and underwear. He hooked a finger underneath, and it very intentionally brushed againat her clit, making her squeak. He quickly rips off the rest of her clothing.
                        
                                    <p>The bear then brings their faces closer together. A claw grips the area on Amy's face where he had previously bitten her, making it bleed again, and making her wince, a tear rolling down on that side. With his fingers covered in blood, he rubs it on her mouth. The blood gets inside and she tries to spit it out, but this only allows him to stuff a finger inside, moving it around her mouth, making her gag at the tangy flavor. He takes his finger out to her relief, but that doesn't last long as he begins pressing his mouth to hers, trying to kiss her. She grunts and kicks her legs, and tries to keep her mouth closed while he licks her lips with his rough tongue. When that fails she bites his tongue as hard as she can, but the deters him little. If anything it only encourages his kiss to become even more rough.
                        
                                        <p>The bear moans as he finally breaks the kiss, leaving behind a string of red saliva between the two. Suddenly he grabs Amy by the throat, and smiles, showing all his teeth. She continues to squirm and struggle, which only makes him laugh. "Good, keeping fighting like that. It only makes me more excited." he spoke directly in her ear. His other hand moves down to his growing erection, stroking it to full length. Once he's done, he pushes the thrashing girl's pussy against it.
                        
                                            <p>Amy blanched at the size of the cock below her. It was somehow almost as wide as her torso... there was no way it would fit into her. Her anger faded and her heart started racing as the monstrous bear grabbed ahold of her sides and started forcing her open anyway, barely prepared. "No, no!" Her voice was shaking tremendously.
                        
                                                <p>He continued breaching her despite the friction. He stared into Amy's widening, teary eyes. "I've enjoyed our time together, my dear. And now, I'm going to enjoy breaking you."
                        
                                                    <p>"You caaaAAAAHHH!!!" Her cries became a screech as he thrusts hard into her. Barely wet, the intrusion feels like a burning rod piercing her insides. Her screaming echoed through the small room, making the bear groan in pleasure. What a beautiful sound, what a satisfying feeling to put a girl in such pain. It gave him the rush he had craved for so long. Blood dripped from her overstretched opening. It didn't do much to slicken the movement, but he thought his cock looked so pretty covered in this shade of crimson.
                        
                                                        <p>By now Amy's screaming had become breathy sobs. She had run out of energy to scream, and her body tried to find some way to relax itself as the bear kept slamming into her. He moved a hand to wipe her tears, only to put his finger in his mouth to taste the salty water. She closed her eyes after that. She couldn't look at this cruel beast anymore.
                        
                                                            <p>He pushed farther and farther in, going through her cervix. Her belly had a huge bump in it, and she could feel her pulse through the thinning skin. It caused her to hyperventilate. More blood splashed out of her, staining her fur and the floor. He just kept going. His thrusts became harder, pushed deeper inside, and her body's resistance seemed to weaken more and more.
                        
                                                                <p>Amy was panicking as she started to feel something inside her tearing. She tried weakly again to struggle, to kick, to yell, to do anything to make this stop. But it wouldn't be enough, she knew. He was going to go all the way. The pain got worse and worse, beyond anything she thought possible. She felt like she was being torn apart. She realized, she *is* being torn apart.
                        
                                                                    <p>"P-lease," she begged, coughing. Anything, anything to make it stop. Even if it wouldn't work, she had to try something, she didn't want to go like this...
                        
                                                                        <p>The sound of flesh ripping filled the room. Blood and organs splattered around. The waves of pain and relent of resistance hit Amy. It was worse than everything before. The only sound she could make now was a low gurgle, as blood had filled her throat and leaked out of her mouth. She opened her eyes again to see this throbbing mound pireced through her belly, covered in pink and white and red.
                        
                                                                            <p>Soon, colors faded from her vision. Black and white dots lined her vision.
                        
                                                                                <p>The last thing she heard was a horrible, joyful laugh.
                        
                                                                                    <p>Finally she lost consciousness.
                        
                                                                                        <p>She escaped to her mind. There was nowhere else to go.
                        
                                                                                            <p>...
                        
                                                                                                <p>...
                        
                                                                                                    <p><i>The lights in the sky move about like ocean waves. Red and pink reflected off the white snow, making it appear to glow. I stare in awe at the surroundings. I hadn't thought such an empty-looking place like Aurora Icefield could have a view so spectacular.</i>
                        
                                                                                                        <p><i>I heard a small chuckle beside me. I looked over to my partner. Bark seemed just as entranced as I was. The view never got old for him. His eyes were half-lidded, and he had a peaceful smile. My heart was set aflutter, hearing and seeing him so happy.</i>
                        
                                                                                                            <p><i>I snuggle up closer to him. In turn, he wraps his arm around my back, pulling us closer together. I sigh happily and close my eyes, letting myself drift off to sleep, safe and happy in my love's arms.</i>
