                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> They seem to have bit off more than they could chew with this installment in terms of lore, so I'm trying to piece together some parts to be more coherent. Also a bit of a fixfic.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>The Black Dragon and its origin</h4>
<p>In game we get little to no foreshadowing about this thing, besides Trio of Trouble (which is out of the game) and the Golden Capital mural (which is hard to make out). To remedy this I would just change some of the graphics to include some more markings about the fact that dragons exist on this island. Perhaps in a place like Sky Temple, as temples are known to have things relevant to cultures like artwork telling a story.</p>
<p>Before I get to said story, I want to talk about the Black Dragon's design. I think the one used is just ok. It looks more like a robot though. However compared to what we could have had, it's a missed opportunity. There is a design of the dragon that more resembles Super Trip. And I think, had we had that one, we could draw some interesting conclusions about the dragon and Trip's tribe. What if this dragon was a previous member who lost control of themselves and became greedy? More on this a little later...</p>
<h4>The Northstar Tribe and the Guardian Animals</h4>
<p>It's very lightly implied Trip has a connection to the large animals on the island. She's able to make the giant octopus move out of the way for Amy. I think perhaps she asked the giant monkey in Frozen Base Zone to help as well. I wish that there had been greater utilizing of these animals within the story and lore. Maybe tie the Chaos Emeralds' new powers into powers for the animals, or at least the zones (something that is arguable already done to an extent). A power corresponding to a goant animal like the octopus for water, the snake for slow, a jungle animal for ivy, so on. Have the animals begin to show and help Sonic and friends as they realize they are here to help.</p>
<p>It's also obvious that the people of Northstar have a deeper connection to the Emeralds as seen with Trip's transformation into a dragon contrasting other super forms we have seen. There's SOMETHING special about this island and these jewels. Is this island their origin, in the classic universe? Do they have any connection to the Echidna Tribe? Maybe! It'd be interesting to try to make one.</p>
<h4>The Emeralds Purpose</h4>
<p>I think the mural in Golden Capital is trying to imply that the Emeralds are meant to maintain a balance on the island, one that is shifted and broken when Eggman uses his weird time device and the Black Onyx. Previously, the Northstar tribe used it and the Emeralds to seal away the Black Dragon after it becomes power hungry and destructive. They may have lost a good number of their people in trying to do so, which is why Trip eventually ends up as the last one. However, for some reason, the dragon only shows up as the last thing in game; long after Eggman and Fang are defeated, things should have wrapped up. Why? Wouldn't it be cooler, and make more sense, if it was a bonus boss for collecting all the emeralds, like Doomsday Zone in S3&amp;K? And its release and subsequent destruction of the land is the bad end?</p>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>I would have definitely changed around that order. Have the main story go as planned, then if you have all the Emeralds, fight the Black Dragon as Eggman releases it. If they aren't all collected, have a bad ending similar to the one in Chaotix. No need for a last story. Trip's story would remain mostly the same, except change the final act 2 into wither a new level or just the Fang boss, as I feel that completes Trip's arc just fine.</p>
<p>Also, change Trio of Trouble to be <em>in </em>the game, as it contains important information. Perhaps shorten it and put it before or after Sand Sanctuary. Alternatively, keep it as is and have the players see the murals in game as well as in the short.</p>
<p>And please make the bosses better. Good lord. Let us hit them as much as we want like in previous games. They are far too slow and boring, and the Black Dragon fight does not have enough rings to do properly.</p>
