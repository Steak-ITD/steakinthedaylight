                    <hr>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sonic, is your speed really limitless?&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />Sonic was taken from his nap by Tails' sudden question. &ldquo;Hmmm? Oh, uh... I dunno. Probably,&rdquo; he says groggily, feeling lulled by the rhythm of the ocean's waves.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;You don't have any idea at all?&rdquo; Tails asks again.</p>
<p><br />Sonic yawns for a bit before responding.&ldquo;I haven't thought of the specifics too much. I guess I'm not as inquisitive as you~&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; Tails sighs, &ldquo;I'm asking because I've heard rumors about how fast you can move. Some say you could run at the speed of light, which I have doubts about.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second or 299,792,458 meters per second. Fast enough to travel across the entire planet 9 times in 1 second.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />Sonic chuckles. &ldquo;Well, I'm flattered! But no, I can't run *that* fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />Tails hums affirmatively. Glancing over to see his thinking face, Sonic continues, &ldquo;If you must know, I have reached the speed of sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;Really!?&rdquo; Tails sat up quickly and stared right at him.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;Yes, once back at home when I had a lot of space. I'm sure you know this,&rdquo; he yawns again, &ldquo; but going that fast tends to be destructive. So I haven't done it since.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;You have to show me! I can find a place with enough space!&rdquo; Tails exclaims.</p>
<p><br />&rdquo;Hmm... I'll think about it.&ldquo;</p>
<p><br />&rdquo;W-what do you mean you'll think about it?&ldquo;</p>
<p><br />Sonic yawns again, much longer this time. &rdquo;Too tired to talk, sorry.&ldquo; He turned back over and closed his eyes.</p>
<p><br />&rdquo;Hey!&ldquo; Tails yelled, but Sonic was already asleep again. He pouted and laid back down himself. He closed his eyes. He was going to ask again in the morning. No way he was gonna let this go.</p>
