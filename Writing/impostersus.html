                    <hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Straight up the premise is saddening; two people are kidnapped and live experimented on for several months, have their entire personalities rewritten and turned into one-note imitations of people they have never met. No records of their previous lives are kept so when they learned about all this, they have nothing to return to and go off of. And neither do the readers for that matter; there have been no hints or foreshadowing about where they might have come from. Not a single thing. This must have been a deliberate choice, but why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah obviously this revelation is heartbreaking and angering, but it bothers me that Surge's first response is to take out the anger on the entire world, which by this point she hasn't had any exposure to. Rather than. Try to fix all this. And later thinking no one out there is looking for her, which she can't possibly know because again, just been exposed to the world. Also, they were kept hidden for months, it's highly likely said people don't know where to look. It never crosses anyone's mind again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And she seems to somehow lack the realization that maybe her wanting to destroy everything is another result of the programming. Remember she only hates Sonic because of that? Are we just done questioning this? Ok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way she talks to Kit is abusive and cruel, it's barely any better after the truth reveal, and it clearly has affected him severely. He has zero self-worth at all. He was programmed to be a one-note servant and his actual personality struggles to get out due to the influence of his superiors. And this mentally programmed reliance actively prevents him from making better life choices. He literally takes all abuse from Surge. He has a chronic obsession with being <em>needed</em>. He can't process kindness from anyone, and can't understand why anyone would be nice to him if they don't want to use him. Apparently refused to accept the fact that Sonic legit didn't know Surge was still alive. Oh, and when he thinks she's dead he breaks and absolutely needs someone to serve. It's sad and disturbing how messed up he is, and depressing how he ends up cold and bitter by the end, and you can just tell it's still a result of the programming, the thing he said to Sonic is so infuriating because we all know that isn't true,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Sonic and Tails find out how they came to be they are rightfully horrified and all they want to do is help these poor people, but they refuse, out of resignation, I guess. But. WHY. It doesn't have to be like this at all. If they want revenge, well, the person who did all this is dead so. That's not an excuse anymore. She insists she can never be free but they clearly haven't even <em>tried</em>. Again, can't hypnosis be undone? I refuse to believe there can't be a way if it exists in the first place in this universe and it's odd how not a single character suggests this. Neither of them considered trying to find out anything about their old lives. They're just giving in to the programming, anyone can see how it is still dictating their actions throughout the whole story, and it's so frustrating and dismal to read this knowing all that.</p>

<p>This excerpt from the Headscratchers TV Tropes page:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Imposter Syndrome Issue #3 reveals how Surge and Kit have no past because of Dr. Starline's meddling and actions. It's natural how angry they are and <strong>questionable to see them want to take this out on Sonic and Eggman before meeting them,</strong> but could they recruit The Chaotix to find out who they were beforehand?</p>
<p>The Chaotix are associated with Sonic, and they (Surge and Kit) want to destroy everyone and everything even associated with him and Eggman. Starline appears to keep Surge and Kit on a tight leash, and his brainwashing is intended to make them as single-mindedly evil apossible.</p>
<p>It's possible they don't know the Chaotix exist. Even if they did, Starline would have put them on his enemies list.</p>
<p><strong>There are detectives beside the Chaotix. Also, it would not be hard to just comb missing person reports until they found someone resembling either of them who went missing just before they were brainwashed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<li>
<p>One of this comic's mandates is that Sonic has to win in the end, which is clearly not what happened here. This could mean either 1. It's not over, 2. That was a fucking lie, or 3. This is actually supposed to be a <em>happy</em> end somehow. 1 is the only good choice here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is by far the most psychologically dark and heart-wrenching thing to ever come out of this series in my eyes. SA2 has absolutely nothing on this. Why would Ian and/or Evan write it this way? I really hope it doesn't just leave off like this.</p>
