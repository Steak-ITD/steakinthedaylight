                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Rape</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Requested by the guest beefwhich, Amitie and Sig rape Lidelle.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"Wait, Amitie! Sig! I don't want this!" Lidelle yelled and yelled, but they wouldn't listen. Sig kept pulling her underwear down, and Amitie slowly rubbed her head.</p>

<p>"Hey, don't worry, ok? It'll be fun, I promise!" She raised Lidelle's head and kissed her lips. Meanwhile Sig spread her legs. She tried to resist both, but they held onto her tightly.</p>

<p>Sig began to lick her vagina, causing her to gasp. Amitie took the chance to stuff her tongue into Lidelle's mouth. She tried again to push her away, to no avail. This was already more stimulation than she wanted.</p>

<p>Her struggles continued for a few minutes. Eventually, the two of them stopped, giving Lidelle some relief. Maybe they finally realized they were hurting her.</p>

<p>"She tasted real good, huh?" Amitie said, caressing Lidelle's cheek. Sig nodded and licked his lips. Lidelle was scared at how calmly they were talking. Almost like she wasn't really there. But she went into a panic when she felt something pushing into her down below.</p>

<p>"Relax, or it won't fit," Sig said, slowly penetrating her with his penis.</p>

<p>"I-I don't want it to fit!" Lidelle sobbed and tensed up. Sig sighed and just spread her opening further with his hands until he was able to push in deep enough.</p>

<p>It hurt at first, but only a little. Afterwards, it felt <i>good</i>, which terrified Lidelle. She didn't enjoy this, she didn't understand why it felt good, or why they wouldn't stop no matter what she said. All of this was too much. She began to cry.</p>

<p>"Aw, hey, it's ok," Amitie wiped away her tears and kissed her cheek. "I know it feels weird at first, but it gets much better."</p>

<p>Amitie didn't get it. She didn't get it at all. Within Lidelle's fear and sadness arose anger. Why wouldn't they see they were causing her so much pain? Did they want to hurt her?</p>

<p>Sig moved back and forth within her, and her sobs mixing with moans. She hears moaning from Amitie as well; she was touching herself to the sight, right next to Lidelle.</p>

<p>It felt like hours had passed before Sig came in her and pulled out. Then they both released her.</p>

<p>Lidelle wanted to scream, wanted to hit them and run away as far as possible. But she also didn't want to move, or do anything but disappear into the ground.</p>

<p>"I don't think she liked it," Sig said, looking her over.</p>

<p>Amitie looked over at her too. "Maybe we were too rough after all? Well, let's try to be more gentle next time."</p>

<p>Lidelle curled into a ball. Full of despair and betrayal, she cried again to herself.</p>
