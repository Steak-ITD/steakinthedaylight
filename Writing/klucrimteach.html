                    <p>The demon's patience was wearing thin. Every day, that same boy would come to their manor, and every day, he would ask the same thing; a mentorship from the demon. Every day, they would refuse and remove him from their home. Yet he still came back, as adamant as ever.</p>
<p>This boy had no fear of the demon's power, or he just hid it well. Admittedly, it was intriguing. What was also intriguing was how he managed to get through the demon's little magic tricks to try and keep him away. Not that they were trying that hard anyway, but his sheer determination stood out to them.</p>
<p>The demon sat at their study, and began to seriously consider the idea.</p>
<p>This was not the first time a human had come to them seeking their magical knowledge. And they did enjoy sharing and persuing such knowledge. They supposed teaching wouldn't detract from that. Although they liked being alone, having someone to consistently share new info with sounded rather nice.</p>
<p>The boy was clearly dedicated, as he kept pushing through those little trick of theirs. He had bragged about being such a good student, top of his class. Interesting then, that he sought out more studying. Perhaps mentoring him would be an interesting challenge.</p>
<p>The demon grinned to themself. They'd decided. Now, they had to wait.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the boy came around the same time as always. He had managed again to break through their weak magical barrier using his own dark magic. This time, the demon walked down to meet him.</p>
<p>"Listen," they said before he could speak. "I've made a decision." They noticed the boy's eyes widen.</p>
<p>"You'll teach me after all!?" he exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>"Yes. But I won't make it easy for you, since you're so smart already. I will make sure you feel sufficiently challenged by the end of each day. You'll come here at this time, 5 days a week, and I will train you for 3 hours. Tomorrow, you'll show me what you know already. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>The boy nodded vigourously. The demon grinned in return. "Now then..."</p>
<p>"Klug."</p>
<p>"Klug. I have to prepare. But let me leave you with a small parting 'gift'. I'm sure you can figure it out." The demon chanted a spell and waved their hand. Another barrier, this time trapping the boy inside their manor. They saw mild suprise on the boy's face, then a small smile. With that, they went back up to prepare their future lessons.</p>
