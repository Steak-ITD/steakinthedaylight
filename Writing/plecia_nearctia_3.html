                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> m/m rape</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> This is where I get kind of shy about things... I'm not sure if I did the mental justification very well, I did want it to be repetive, and show that he doesn't get how forceful he's actually being or that Lemres is scared because of how he's acting.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"What are you doing here?" Lemres looked at Sig with worry. "Did you come in through the door?"</p>
<p>Sig looked back at him. He had no idea how he should feel. He was happy to see Lemres. He was nervous about having been seen in his bedroom. "Yeah, I was going to close them, but..."</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>"... I was curious."</p>
<p>"Um, okay," Lemres sighed. "I'm sorry, I didn't have a good night, and I wasn't expecting you to. Well. I guess it wasn't a break-in, since I apparently left everything open."</p>
<p>Sig stared at him as he talked. He noticed he did indeed look stressed. His brow was furrowed, his hair looked scruffed, and he was generally tense. It was interesting seeing him this way, but sad at the same time. He probably would have remained that way the whole night. But maybe... he didn't have to.</p>
<p>"It's ok, maybe I can help you." He moved closer. No counter to keep them apart now.</p>
<p>"What? Sig, this isn't really ok. You just came into my home - what are you doing?"</p>
<p>Sig wrapped his arms around Lemres's waist. "You're upset. I want you to feel better," he said. He felt him try to shimmy out of his grip, but he just held tighter. "That's what 'friends' do."</p>
<p>"W-well, yes, but this is..." he didn't finish. Sig was very close to him now, closer than they'd ever been. He could feel Lemres' quick breaths on his skin. He wanted him to calm down. When they were together, they should be calm.</p>
<p>He pressed his lips against the nervous baker's own. They were soft and delicate, exactly as he imagined them to be. He could feel them trembling as well, so he tried to deepen their kiss, but he was met with a pushback. Lemres had pushed him away.</p>
<p>"I-! I'm sorry, but I don't- I-" he seemed barely able to talk. That was ok. There was no need for talking right now. There was no need for him to worry. Sig would handle things.</p>
<p>"I can take care of you," he said softly. "I've thought of you so much every day. I know you so well now that I've seen your home. I want to know you more." He walked closer to Lemres again, but he kept backing away. It didn't deter him. He kept approaching, knowing he would have him eventually.</p>
<p>Before he could react, something was flung at his face. He looked down to see it was one of the books Lemres read. He looked back up, and no one was there. Dazed, he looked around to find Lemres trying to unlock his door. He was trying to leave.<br />No, no, he couldn't go yet. He couldn't. He had to help him. He had to, had to stop him.</p>
<p>Just as Lemres got the door open, Sig pounced on him. Forgetting the stairs were below. The two fell to the bottom. When they stopped, Sig was the first to get up. He looked down at Lemres wide-eyed when he saw he wasn't moving. He brought his hand to his wrist. Fortunately, he was just unconscious. This was... good, this was fine. He could still make this ok.</p>
<p>Sig got off the ground and picked Lemres up with him. He walked back up the stairs carefully and back into the bedroom, laying the unconscious man on his bed. Then he stopped to take a look. He seemed so peaceful now, much calmer than before. But he knew it wouldn't last. He went to his drawers, looking for something thin. He found a couple of ties in the top drawer. These would do. He went back to the bed, lifted Lemres' arms toward the bed frame, and tied his wrists. Now, he wouldn't be able to run away again. Sig sat next to him on the bed and listened to his now steady breaths.</p>
<p>Even like this, he was still so endearing. Sig couldn't help but smile. He thought he understood his longing now. This kind of connection, it was wonderful, painful, and all-consuming. He wanted Lemres to understand, too. He was just too scared right now. But that was ok. He had said he would make it better.</p>
<p>Sig began to straddle the sleeping baker. He laid on top of him. His body was so soft and warm, even like this. Now that he was unimpeded, he could get a better sense of his scent. It was beautifully sweet, just as he thought it would be. He leaned down to kiss him again, this time on the cheek. Then his hand touched the spot where he kissed and moved down his face, to his chest, and to his belly. He squeezed the plush skin. Its shape was perfect. He leaned down, planting more kisses on his stomach.</p>
<p>He heard a groan from above. Lemres must be waking up. He moved back up, so the first thing he'd see was his face. His eye was open. It was a pale golden. It fit the rest of his body so well.</p>
<p>"...what happened? I'm... home?" Lemres said groggily.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're home."</p>
<p>"What are you..." he tried to move his hands, realizing they were tied together.</p>
<p>"You're stressed. I'm here to help."</p>
<p>"Help? I don't need..."</p>
<p>Sig shushed him and kissed his cheek again. "Don't worry. We're together now. Everything will be ok."</p>
<p>He could tell the panic was returning. He put his hands to Lemres' sides and slowly rubbed them. He would never get tired of feeling his skin. He moved down to his belly again, and then to his legs... these pants were in the way, so Sig began pulling them down. He felt a struggle but still managed to shake them off. And there they were, his lovely legs laid bare.</p>
<p>Lemres was breathing heavily now. He was pleading for him not to go on. He was still so stressed... Couldn't he see he didn't need to worry? He was with his friend... no, they were more than that now. What they had was special, between just them. He wanted to consummate that bond now, more than anything. He started to pull his pants off, just to be fair.</p>
<p>Sig noticed the tent in his underwear at last. He giggled despite himself. He really was a simple man. He took his underwear off, too, revealing his erect member. He sighed as he moved to touch himself, rubbing languidly. He looked back up at Lemres, who had his head turned away. His legs had closed themselves instinctively. Sig had to pull them apart himself, and with some resistance, he managed to remove the other's underwear as well.</p>
<p>His dick was only at half-hardness. Sigmoved in between the legs, took it in his hand, and pushed it against his own, stroking them simultaneously. He moaned as he felt pre cum begin to drip from them both. He swiped the droplets with his finger and licked them up. He could hear his heart beating in his ears. He was becoming more and more excited. He moved his member away and shifted himself to the right angle...</p>
<p>"Please, please don't do this," Lemres begged him. Sig looked up to see tears in his eyes. "I- I'll forgive you if you stop now, we can still be friends, j-just, please."</p>
<p>"Lemres..." he moved a hand to his tear-stricken face and wiped them away. Even now, he was so gorgeous, so graceful. "... I can't just be your friend. I'm in love. I have been since the day we met.</p>
<p>"I want to show you."</p>
<p>The first push was the hardest. They both grit their teeth as Sig slide further inside. Once he was all the way in, he pulled out a bit. He could feel the muscles trying to pull him back in. So he pushed again, much smoother this time. And he kept going like that, pushing in and out, listening to the gasps from the other man. They sounded so wonderful with his own moans.</p>
<p>They went on like this for a while. He couldn't tell how long, but he didn't ever want it to end. He was joined together with his mate, like the lovebugs he was so enamored by. He felt like he could melt into the man below him, hugging him closer. He was complete.</p>
<p>His climax came like a raging river, almost screaming in pleasure as he filled Lemres with his cum. He felt the other cum as well, marking both of their chests with white. He fell slowly from his high, holding his warm mate tight. His breath was shaky.</p>
<p>Sig took another look at Lemres. He wasn't crying anymore, though it seemed he had been before, as he still sniffled. He leaned in to kiss him, this time being met with no resistance. He must finally be relaxed now. Good, there wasn't any reason for him to be worried. They were together.</p>
<p>"I love you," he whispered, kissing him again, before letting himself nod off.</p>
