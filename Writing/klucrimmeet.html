                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> New ship dropped. Kind of. This is the second thing I wrote, taking place soon after Klug finds out about the demon. Originally ended after he returns to the study, I added the day they decide to teach him as both excerpts were pretty short.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>*thump!*</p>
<p>A loud noise interuppted the demon from their book. What could it have been? Everything in their home should be in order. It came from downstairs, towards the front. Breathing in and out, they expel their soul to investigate.</p>
<p>They sense a small bit of magic, and follow it to the source of the noise: a young boy, probably a teenager, sitting in front of the door to their home. He must have used a simple teleportation spell to get to the other side of the door. No one had done that in years. In any case, he was an intruder...</p>
<p>The boy looked up and saw the demon's soul staring him down. Of course, he looked shocked to see such a thing. Sure enough, when the demon teleported their body to their soul's location, the boy was even more shocked to see them suddenly appear. They were much larger than the teenage boy, who looked small just sitting there in awe.</p>
<p>"What purpose do you have for coming here?" the demon speaks, somewhat impatiently. Their soul still loomed around them, creating a threatening air.</p>
<p>The boy got up, dusted himself off, and readjusted his glasses. He stood as tall as he could, and said, "You're the Crimson Demon, right?"</p>
<p>"So they call me. Now, what do you want?"</p>
<p>"My name is Klug, and I want you to mentor me!"</p>
<p>Well, that's a surprise. Humans came to them to ask for their knowledge on something, usually magic. But teaching someone was different. This boy also seemed very confident in himself. As if he was expecting a yes simply for being so. How impudent. "And why should I do such a thing?"</p>
<p>"I've heard tales of your magic power. It inspired me to come find you. I want to learn all I can."</p>
<p>"Hmm. You're quite a flatterer, aren't you?" The demon thought out loud. "But, no. I don't have time to babysit."</p>
<p>That seemed to fluster the boy a bit. "I'm not that young! And I promise you, teaching me will be worth your time. I'm at the top of my class, you know."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you are. But still, no. Now," the demon turns around. "I have a book to get back to."</p>
<p>"But-!" Before the boy can continue, the demon waves their hand, and he's poofed away, to the outside of their home. They begin walking back to their study, ignoring the soft pounding coming from the door.</p>
<p>This was a mild bit of amusement, but nothing much to think more of. Or so they thought.</p>
<p>The demon's patience was wearing thin. Every day, that same boy would come to their manor, and every day, he would ask the same thing; a mentorship from the demon. Every day, they would refuse and remove him from their home. Yet he still came back, as adamant as ever.</p>
<p>This boy had no fear of the demon's power, or he just hid it well. Admittedly, it was intriguing. What was also intriguing was how he managed to get through the demon's little magic tricks to try and keep him away. Not that they were trying that hard anyway, but his sheer determination stood out to them.</p>
<p>The demon sat at their study, and began to seriously consider the idea.</p>
<p>This was not the first time a human had come to them seeking their magical knowledge. And they did enjoy sharing and persuing such knowledge. They supposed teaching wouldn't detract from that. Although they liked being alone, having someone to consistently share new info with sounded rather nice.</p>
<p>The boy was clearly dedicated, as he kept pushing through those little trick of theirs. He had bragged about being such a good student, top of his class. Interesting then, that he sought out more studying. Perhaps mentoring him would be an interesting challenge.</p>
<p>The demon grinned to themself. They'd decided. Now, they had to wait.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the boy came around the same time as always. He had managed again to break through their weak magical barrier using his own dark magic. This time, the demon walked down to meet him.</p>
<p>"Listen," they said before he could speak. "I've made a decision." They noticed the boy's eyes widen.</p>
<p>"You'll teach me after all!?" he exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>"Yes. But I won't make it easy for you, since you're so smart already. I will make sure you feel sufficiently challenged by the end of each day. You'll come here at this time, 5 days a week, and I will train you for 3 hours. Tomorrow, you'll show me what you know already. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>The boy nodded vigourously. The demon grinned in return. "Now then..."</p>
<p>"Klug."</p>
<p>"Klug. I have to prepare. But let me leave you with a small parting 'gift'. I'm sure you can figure it out." The demon chanted a spell and waved their hand. Another barrier, this time trapping the boy inside their manor. They saw mild suprise on the boy's face, then a small smile. With that, they went back up to prepare their future lessons.</p>
