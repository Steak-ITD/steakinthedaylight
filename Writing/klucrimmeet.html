                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> New ship dropped. Kind of. This is the second thing I wrote, taking place soon after Klug finds out about the demon.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>*thump!*</p>
<p>A loud noise interuppted the demon from their book. What could it have been? Everything in their home should be in order. It came from downstairs, towards the front. Breathing in and out, they expel their soul to investigate.</p>
<p>They sense a small bit of magic, and follow it to the source of the noise: a young boy, probably a teenager, sitting in front of the door to their home. He must have used a simple teleportation spell to get to the other side of the door. No one had done that in years. In any case, he was an intruder...</p>
<p>The boy looked up and saw the demon's soul staring him down. Of course, he looked shocked to see such a thing. Sure enough, when the demon teleported their body to their soul's location, the boy was even more shocked to see them suddenly appear. They were much larger than the teenage boy, who looked small just sitting there in awe.</p>
<p>"What purpose do you have for coming here?" the demon speaks, somewhat impatiently. Their soul still loomed around them, creating a threatening air.</p>
<p>The boy got up, dusted himself off, and readjusted his glasses. He stood as tall as he could, and said, "You're the Crimson Demon, right?"</p>
<p>"So they call me. Now, what do you want?"</p>
<p>"My name is Klug, and I want you to mentor me!"</p>
<p>Well, that's a surprise. Humans came to them to ask for their knowledge on something, usually magic. But teaching someone was different. This boy also seemed very confident in himself. As if he was expecting a yes simply for being so. How impudent. "And why should I do such a thing?"</p>
<p>"I've heard tales of your magic power. It inspired me to come find you. I want to learn all I can."</p>
<p>"Hmm. You're quite a flatterer, aren't you?" The demon thought out loud. "But, no. I don't have time to babysit."</p>
<p>That seemed to fluster the boy a bit. "I'm not that young! And I promise you, teaching me will be worth your time. I'm at the top of my class, you know."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you are. But still, no. Now," the demon turns around. "I have a book to get back to."</p>
<p>"But-!" Before the boy can continue, the demon waves their hand, and he's poofed away, to the outside of their home. They begin walking back to their study, ignoring the soft pounding coming from the door.</p>
<p>This was a mild bit of amusement, but nothing much to think more of. Or so they thought.</p>
