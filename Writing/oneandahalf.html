                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Based on a dream and headcanon about Klug and the Crimson Demon fully merging their souls together, based on the fact that in Puyo 7 Klug's mega form is just Strange Klug. I think they both desire the combined power and freedom, and my interpretation is that they eventually permanently fuse as a compromise.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"You've said it yourself before, haven't you? We are as one," the demon in the book spoke slowly, carefully to Klug. "This would only solidify that." It was the most it had said to him in years. He was surprised it remembered after so long. He was less mature back then, suseptible to his own whims. He liked to think he was wiser now.</p>
<p>And yet the allure of power still hooked him in.</p>
<p>The proposal was simple but loaded. They would merge their souls together using a dark magic spell. It would require extra ingredients, but it was nothing he couldn't acquire with some effort. It seemed almost too convenient. Klug wondered how the demon knew of this spell in the first place. "And afterward, I would retain control of myself?" he asked. He had little memory of the possessions of the past. Only a fleeting feeling of being closed off, trapped, and tethered. He had to be sure.</p>
<p>"Of course," the demon spoke. "This is no mere possession; our very beings will be combined, creating something new..." As confident as it sounded, there was a hint of desperation in its tone. He considered its words. If this even worked, there was a chance for them both to get what they wanted. Perhaps their last chance.</p>
<p>"Then... we have a deal."</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It took a few secretive days of preparation. Now, in front of him were all the components needed. Klug felt only a bit uneasy, but he couldn't let his nerves get the best of him. He'd come this far. It was within his reach.</p>
<p>He began to recite the incantation. Immediately, he felt something tugging deep within himself. The ingredients and the demon soul began to glow a bright lavender. As he continued, a tearing noise ripped through the secluded area. Purple and red shreds of light filled his mind and his sight. He was feeling winded but kept going anyway.</p>
<p>The tugging became pulling, and the colors in his mind began to twist and curl together. Continuing the spell was a struggle, but he kept going anyway, not quite in pain, but still strained. Finally, he finished, and he closed his eyes to let the magic continue its work.</p>
<p>Red and purple wrenched, and once tied, they began to glow and mix like wet paints. The ties slowly changed, dripping into each other, creating a rich magenta.</p>
<p>Klug opened his eyes. At some point, he had fallen to the ground, but he felt fine otherwise. There was a sense of freedom, like being released from chains. And yet the force within him felt dark and heavy. This was what the demon had been holding? Was this power really his now?</p>
<p><em>We are as one,</em> a voice echoed in his head.</p>
<p>He laughed to himself. There was much studying to be done.</p>

<p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;">Now the interesting part is how their peers react to this in the future. I suppose they'd have to accept this was a mutual decision, realize their friend isn't truely gone but much different now. It'll be hard to get used to. I'll try to write about it, but it may be a bit fragmented...</p>
