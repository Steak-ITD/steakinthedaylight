                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> This is a story based on the line in Puzzle Pop about Amitie having a mysterious upbringing and a theory that she simply came into existence by herself. So my conclucsion is that she lives by herself off the land because she has never known anything else. It is also a ship fic. Another of my favorite ships is Raffina x Amitie and I wanted to imagine a scenario of Raffina doing something kind for Amitie.</p>
                    <hr>
<p>“Thanks for collecting fruit with me, Raffina!” Amitie cheerfully exclaims while the girls walk through town holding baskets of fresh berries, “i'd never have gotten those high up ones without your kicks.”</p><p>“Don't mention it. I can always use the workout. And I need to make sure my rival is in tip top shape.” That's what Raffina said out loud. She wouldn't admit it, but lately, hanging out with Amitie made her feel nice. Her energy was contagious. When Amitie giggled at her reply, it made her smile. “How much farther to your place?”</p><p>“Just a bit more this way.” They continued walking towards the outskirts of town. They went into a small wooded area, tall trees providing ample shade. Raffina thought they were going out unusually far.</p><p>She spots a small makeshift tent made of sticks, leaves and mud. A pile of thicker wood lay next to it. “Here we are!”</p><p>“This is it?” Raffina spoke without thinking. It was a shock. She wasn't expecting anything grand, but she expected much more than what she was seeing.</p><p>“Yuop, it;s pretty small, but it's home, for now.” Amitie set her basket inside the tent. Of course, there was hardly anything inside; just a lamp and a sleeping bag. “The trees are also great for shielding from the rain.”</p><p>“That's... nice.” Raffina couldn't say much. She was still shocked, and there was a lot going through her mind. What did Amitie mean by “for now”? Did she not have a real place to stay? Did she live by herslef? For how long? It must have been a while, she was acting so nonchalant about it. Why hadn't any of the adults noticed? Why hadn't <em>she</em> noticed?</p><p>“Hey Raffina, could you put the fruit down in here?” She was snapped out of her thoughts by the question. She was still holding these berries. She went over to the small tent and placed them next to the other basket. She noted again just how small the inside was.</p><p>“As the sun set, the weather grew colder. The campfire was lit, providing some warmth and light under the shady trees. The two girls had found smaller sticks the poke through the berries and roast over the fire.</p><p>Raffina thought it couldn't be very filling. But Amitie might not have a job or money to buy bigger meals. This whole situation was really bothering her. Even though they were supposed to be rivals, Amitie was... a good friend.She deserved better than this,</p><p>”Raffina, you've barely touched your food,“ Amitie said. ”Did you burn it? Do you want some of mine?“</p><p>”Amitie. How long have you been alone like this?“</p><p>”Hmm? Alone how? I'm with you, aren't I?“</p><p>”No, I mean, living alone. What about your parents? Your family?“</p><p>Amitie stopped chewing and stared blankly at Raffina. “I... I don't have any. Uh. I never thought about it.”</p><p>The girls sat in silence for a minute, in that minute, Raffina made a decision.</p><p>“Raffina? </p><p>Suddenly she grabbed Amitie's hand. They both stood up and she began to move. ”You're coming with me,“ she said quickly.</p><p>”Huh-!?“ Amitie barely kept up with Raffina, only able to because they held hands. They ran back through town in the sunset.</p><p>Once they stopped, Amitie was out of breath. She looked up trying to catch her breath, only to have it taken away again at the sight before her.</p><p>They had arrived at a mansion. the walls were a light pink that shone in the setting sunlight. They stood in front of a tall golden door. Everything looked clean and ornate, from the windows to the front yard trees.</p><p>”Is this where you live!?” Amitie said in awe.</p><p>“Yes, quite lovely, isn't it?” Raffina replies, feeling her chest swell with pride. She rang the doorbell and it was quickly answered by someone in a fancy looking suit.</p><p>“Good evening, Miss raffina. Dinner will be ready soon,” the butler said.</p><p>“Thank you sir. i'll be going to my room now.” Raffina grabbed Amitie's hand again, and they proceeded into the building.</p><p>It looked even bigger from the inside. There were so many colors, elaborate lights, and huge windows. Amitie wanted to explore the entire area, but Raffina was beelining straight to her room.</p><p>It was some of the prettiest shades of pink and yellow Amitie had ever seen, and was neatly organized, giving plenty of space to move around. Her hand was let go of, and she collapsed onto the soft carpeted floor. She watched Raffina open her large dresser and sift through a few clothes, then pull them out. “You'll wear some of my clothes until we find you a place to stay,” she said matter of factly.</p><p>“Huh? But, I already have-”</p><p>“That hardly counts. I won't have you staying in such a messy state.” Raffina gave Amitie an outfit with a short sleeve shirt and pants. “Like I said, I want my rival to be in tip top shape.”</p><p>Amitie looked at the clothes Raffina gave her. They were some of the nicest clothes she had ever seen, let alone had. A blush crossed her face as she looked up and smiled. “Thanks, Raffina...”</p><p>Seeing her blush, Raffina looked away. “D-don't mention it.”</p><p>Dinner was called just about when the girls finished choosing clothes. They went back down to the dining room, which had a few other people seated already. Raffina introduced them as her parents and sisters, Arabella and Sena. They sat down to a dinner of pork chops, green beans, spiced mash potatoes, and brown rice. </p><p>Amitie stared at the food in awe, it smelled so delicious. When she took a bite, she nearly gasped. “This is sooo good!” she said with a full mouth.</p><p>Raffina watched and smiled to herself. Amitie looked so much brighter now than in those tiny woods. That nice feeling came back to her.</p><p>“Aw look, Raffina impressed her crush!” Sena had noticed Raffina's staring and teased her. Raffina angrily elbows her in the chest.</p>

                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Sorry it's not very long, it's just a little over a thousand words. I haven't been too sure about my writing style lately, mainly how to begin/set up a story or how much detail to give. I think I should have focused more on color contrast.</p>
