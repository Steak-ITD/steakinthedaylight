                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> mental anguish over rape?</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Something happened to me that made me want to continue this story a little. (You can read what happened <a href="/blog.html">here.</a>)</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Still later, she would think about that day.</p>
<p>She didn't know why she couldn't get it out of her head. But then again, she didn't know why she <em>wanted</em> to. It was supposed to be a happy moment. She had to be sure of it.</p>
<p>She had a little idea about things like this. She knew it was something people did when they loved each other. (Like he had said they did.) But she also knew that wasn't always the case. Sometimes there were bad people who would do this to hurt others, to feel powerful for a few moments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, that's not what happened to her. Right? Sure, it felt scary, and a little forceful. But she was in love. And he said he was too. That wasn't a lie, it couldn't be, cause they also kissed, and they both said it, and she trusted him...</p>
<p>But had she wanted to go this far? So quickly?</p>
<p>Why did that question make her feel so bad? Why was it even a question? The answer had to be... yes. But when she tried to answer that way, there was doubt in her mind. She didn't understand. It wasn't that unfamiliar from how she felt that day either. Despite how it made her feel, she tried to think back to it...</p>
<p>She hadn't gotten much of a word in. He did most of the talking, and he was so... assertive in his touch. He... put her fear down, but it had to be to make her feel better about it. So she wouldn't get away?&nbsp;</p>
<p>She started to feel sick. Thinking about it was too hard, and it gave her a headache. She just wanted to be happy. Not have these dumb feeling crawl through her mind, making her doubt how good she should feel...</p>
<p>Maybe... she should tell him how she felt. He would know what to do. But more doubt crept into her mind. She remembered his eyes, his touch. And suddenly, the idea felt wrong. Now it was just getting frustrating. Why did she feel that way?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why why why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did he <em>do</em> this to her?</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> I have no clue if I will continue from here, because I am not sure how. I could also write this from Sonic's perspective, as that was part of the original idea.</p>
