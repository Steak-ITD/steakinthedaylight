                    <hr>
                    <p>It was a lovely warm summer day in Primp. Many people moved about every which way, all having someplace to be. All but Sig it seemed, who resided in the forest. He was doing his usual hobby, observing the bees buzz around, collecting pollen from the local flowers. He felt at peace watching the methodical action.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he remembered something. He did have an appointment to keep after all. He was supposed to meet Lemres, somewhere in this very forest, but he had been entranced by the bees.</p>
<p>Lemres had invited Sig to help him make some sort of new treat, and gave him a location in the woods. He wasn't sure about going at first. That guy had always appeared dubious to him. But he knew his friends seemed to trust him just fine. So he figured there was no harm in going. And he wasn't one to refuse food.</p>
<p>So he followed the directions he'd been given, and come across a small shed sight in the middle of the woods. He knocked on the door which opened very quickly. "Why hello there! Glad to see you!" said the green clad warlock.</p>
<p>"Hi," Sig responded, "Sorry I'm late, I got a bit distracted on the way here."</p>
<p>"That's alright, I'm used to waiting. now, why don't you come inside?"</p>
<p>Sig followed Lemres into the shed. Inside was a clean, pristine kitchen set. Many types of equipment was organized on each counter, save for the large on in the middle of the room. Everything seemed to shine.</p>
<p>"I presume you're hungry already? From a pocket, Lemres pulled out a cookie with white candy inside. "Here, I'd like you to try this first."</p>
<p>"Sure, thanks." Sig took the cookie and bit into it a few times. It was quite soft and warm, just the right amounts of sweet and savory... it made him feel light, like he was floating...?</p>
<p>"Well?" Lemres asked. "How do you feel?"</p>
<p>"Kind of... sleepy..." Sig drawled. The world started to spin, and he couldn't keep balance.</p>
<p>"Good," he heard. That was a strange thing to say, wasn't it? He couldn't think straight. He felt himself start to fall as he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Sig woke up laying down on something smooth and cool. He was facing the ceiling. He tried to move his head, but there was some sort of force keeping him from moving too far. He found it was the same with his limbs. He could hear someone moving around to the side. "Lemres?"</p>
<p>The mage stopped what he was doing and turned. "Oh, I didn't expect you to wake up so soon."</p>
<p>"Why can't I move?" Sig kept trying but could only manage a bit of fidgeting.</p>
<p>"I used a binding spell while you were asleep."</p>
<p>"Why? Aren't I supposed to help you bake?"</p>
<p>Lemres sighed and looked down at his bound guest. "Yes, you are helping me. There's something very important I need from you. I've run out of a certain ingredient, and you're going to help me get more.</p>
<p>Help him get an ingredient? While bound to a counter? That couldn't mean what he thought, right? "You're joking, right?" Sig uttered.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not." Lemres stepped away from the counter, going back to what he was doing before. He pulled open a drawer containing many sharp knives that clanged as he searched for the right one. "What I need, it's very important for me."</p>
<p>So, this was really happening. Sig was going to be baked into a treat. He tried not to panic, though his breath got a little faster. He had to think of some way to get out of this. "You can't my friends will come looking for me."</p>
<p>"Of course they will. But it doesn't matter. They won't find you."</p>
<p>"My bugs, who will take care of them?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure someone will take them up for you in your absence."</p>
<p>"...is... is this about the desert?"</p>
<p>"Oh no no, it's nothing you did. It wasn't easy to pick anyone here, but I was running out of time, I had to chose eventually. I thought maybe your special traits might affect my condition."</p>
<p>"Condition?"</p>
<p>Lemres closed the drawer, having found what he needed. He fidgeted with whatever was in his hand. "Sugar isn't the only thing I crave." He swallowed. "Ever since I was young, I've had this need to... rend flesh. Consume it. I can't function properly without it. I-I need blood from others as much as I need my own," he stuttered with his last words. then he started towards the counter.</p>
<p>"Wait, you don't have to do this," Sig asserted. He was running out of time, his heart began to race, and his words came out quicker."We can find another way, we-"</p>
<p>"There isn't another way," Lemres nearly snapped, then cleared his throat and continued stepping forth. "There's... I've already tried everything. Other animals. Sweets alone. I've even tried using my own blood. but nothing was ever enough. I have to do this."</p>
<p>He finally reached the counter again, moving to the left side. Sig saw what was in his hand; a meat cleaver, clean and dazzling in the light. He also saw the mage's face again. he was frowning, and his closed eyes seemed to droop. It wasn't the face one would expect of a murderer.</p>
<p>Sig began to feel tears dot his eyes. He had never felt so scared and so aware of hopelessness. "Please don't," he begged one more time as Lemres grabbed his left wrist.</p>
<p>He lifted the cleaver, aiming just beyond the left shoulder. "I'm sorry," he whispered, and dropped the knife down. It cut right through the skin. The pain was immediate. Sig gasped and more tears spilled down his face. The knife was swung down again, this time cutting partway through the bone. He heard the gush of his own blood. It made him sob. Once more the knife came down, cutting through the rest of the bone and skin, and then the arm was torn away. He felt a burning absence where it used to be. He could only sob more in disbelief.</p>
<p>Lemres' breath became heavier at the scent of blood that began to waft across the room. He picked up the severed arm and swallowed his spit, his stomach starting to growl. He had waited long enough for this, too long. It was impossible to resist taking a bite despite himself. The flavor was perfect. As sweet as human flesh, with a bit of spice. Immediately after he swallowed, he felt more energetic.</p>
<p>Sig had watched the whole thing. As if this situation could get any more horrific. <em>He really wasn't kidding...</em> he began to feel lightheaded. No way to stumble this time, he simply let his eyes roll back and close. Just before falling unconscious, he hoped he wouldn't have to wake up again.</p>
