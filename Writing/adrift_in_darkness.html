                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> My take on Demon Boyfriend, except it happens against his will, because he loses a music battle against (an evil and fairy-like) Girlfriend. It was written in four 100 word chapters, so I'm putting them all together here.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><br/>Chapter 1: Cost<br/><p>"What's the matter? Having trouble keeping up?"</p><p>Boyfriend fell to his knees. It was just too much.</p><p>"You poor thing." Girlfriend caressed his cheek, and then his forehead. When had she gotten so close? "I know just how to help."</p><p>He gazed at her curiously. Suddenly, he felt a sting in his chest and his head was wracked with pain.</p><p>He held his hands there and felt blood dripping from something hard... horns?</p><p>More blood came from his mouth, thick and black. His body felt so heavy.</p><p>She simply looked at him and giggled. "Don't worry. You'll feel better soon."</p><br />
<br/>Chapter 2: Shade<br/><p>"You've got some nerve, coming over here."</p><p>Already, Pico began to scold him. Boyfriend just stared back, expression unreadable.</p><p>"Well? What do you have to say for yourself?"</p><p>Boyfriend took a long sigh, and closed his eyes.</p><p>The air began to feel heavier.</p><p>It took a moment for Pico to notice the change. He looked around confused. "What... are you doing...?"</p><p>He looked back at Boyfriend. His eyes had opened again, lit with a bright red glow.</p><p>Panicked, he tried to get his weapon. "Don't tell me... you're one of them!?"</p><p>But there was nothing. Nothing but a crushing darkness.</p><br />
<br/>Chapter 3: Fog<br/><p>
  <em>I can't remember that night clearly. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I don't remember why I went there, to find him.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I don't remember what happened... what I did.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It was too dark to see. Too dense to feel anything. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Once it was over, there wasn't anything left. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I'm not sure what I had felt, seeing him again. Anger? Resentment? Fear? What would cause me to react in such a way? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Was it really me...? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Ever since this... transformation, I haven't thought straight. My head feels fogged with a crushing darkness...</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ...Whatever it was I did that night... </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I want to feel that darkness again.</em>
</p><br />
<br/>Chapter 4: Gaze<br/>
<br/><p>"I didn't think you would come back. You left so quickly last time."</p><p>A virulent smile crossed Girlfriend's face. He couldn't meet her gaze. Still, he let her hold his hand, and her other arm wrap around his back. As though she were always there.</p><p>"You feel better now, don't you?"</p><p>Better?</p><p>It was hard to describe this... as better. But it wasn't so bad, was it? </p><p>He was with her now. Isn't that what he wanted in the first place? </p><p>Only she could understand those tenebrific feelings. </p><p>He finally looked her in the eyes. He whispered, "Yeah, I do."</p>
