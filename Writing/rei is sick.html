                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Rei becomes sick. Yu in her childhood foolishness secretly tries to help. It doesn't work. Please heed the warnings. This is a fetish story that ended up being melancholy.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"Rei, Rei, let's go play!" Yu bounces excitedly into their shared room in search of her brother. He was still laying in bed, and didn't move much as she approached. "Hey, wake up sleepyhead! It's morning already!"</p>

<p>"I'm awake..." Rei moaned. "I couldn't get much sleep at all last night. My nose was too stuffy."</p>

<p>"Uh oh, are you sick?" Yu put a hand on Rei's forehead. It was quite hot. He must be running a fever, and his nose was stuffy too. Definitely sick. "Aww, don't worry, I know what will cheer you up. How about I get you a glass of cool lemonade?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, that sounds nice, actually." Rei smiled. "Thanks Yu-" the energetic girl had already started running out to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Looking in the fridge and cupboard, Yu found a lemon and a pitcher of water. She began pouring the water. But as she poured it, she felt a very familiar sensation in her body. She had to pee... But she wanted to finish this first, so she tried holding it in. </p>

<p>
Then she remembered something else. She had heard once from the grownups about pee being used to treat sickness. It gave her an idea. She took a cup, pulled down her skirt and panties, and let her bladder empty into it. It was a clearish yellow, just like lemonade.</p>

<p><br />
She could give this to Rei instead, and he'd be better in no time! It would have to be a secret though. Rei would probably think her idea was too weird and not do it. But if tbe grown ups said it worked, then it had to be true, right?</p>

<p><br />
And, she wouldn't admit it, but curing Rei with something from her own body... The idea made her feel tingly inside.</p>

<p><br />
After putting in an ice cube, she went on her way. "I'm back!" Yu walked more carefully into the room so she wouldn't spill any of the liquid. "Here you go!" She handed the cup to Rei, who took it a bit shakily.</p>

<p><br />
He took a first sip, then scrunched his face. "It's kind of weird tasting... Like, salty, I think?"</p>

<p><br />
"Oh, well, of course it tastes weird. You're sick, so that's gonna mess with your sense of taste."</p>

<p><br />
Rei didn't seem entirely convinced, but he didn't have another explanation either. So he shrugged and kept drinking. Yu watched him happily, feeling very proud of herself.</p>

<p><br />
She continued her idea for several days afterward. Rei remained bedridden, which only heightened her resolve. But then a week passed, and another, and she started to feel unsure. Was this really working? Why was it taking so long? Should she have used someone else's pee? Or just real lemonade?</p>

<p><br />
No, Yu couldn't think like that. It wouldn't do either of them any good. She had to stay positive, for Rei. She kept up her treatment, and her cheer.</p>

<p>Rei had gotten worried too. He felt worse than ever. His stomach hurt so much, and he was sweating a lot, even though he took off the sheets and the windows were open. He couldn't even get out of bed anymore, not without stumbling a lot. And even in bed, he couldn't sleep because he was in so much pain.</p>

<p>He didn't tell this to Yu though. She had been so kind and doting, giving him that lemonade everyday, trying to help him feel better. He didn't want to make her worry. She was doing the best she could. Besides, sicknesses always got worse befire they got better. He was just going through the worst part now. Surely he would get better soon.</p>

<p>Surely.</p>

                    <p>Rei laid in bed. Staring at the ceiling. A blank, salmon color. It was hard to do anything else. He knew he was just laying still, but as he kept staring, he kind of felt light. Like he was floating off the bed, toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>That didn't seem right. He couldn't float, that would be silly. He was too sweaty of course, all that sweat made him too heavy.</p>

<p>Wait, no, he couldn't float at all. What was he thinking? Besides, how could he be so sweaty when he was so cold at the same time? It didn't make sense... He was so cold, deep inside, but hot enough to sweat.</p>

<p>Everything in the room, it looked so bright, he thought his eyes would burn. Was he outside? Was it winter? There must be a snowstorm, he was so cold.</p>

<p>He couldn't move. All he wanted to do was sleep. But no! You can't sleep in the snow, or... But he was just so tired. He closed his eyes, and opened them again, and again, and again, and again. He inhaled, and exhaled again, and again, and again, and again.</p>

<p>Too much snow. breathing in too much snow. and it was freezing him from the inside, he was stuck in place, unable to move because of all the snow</p>

<p>it was so cold inside of him</p>

<p>The ice grabbed him and froze him solid</p>

<p>he tried to call out her name</p>

<p>but the snow was too thick.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Yu came in as usual, with the cup of "lemonade" ready. Something felt off though. Rei hadn't turned to look at her, or said hello or anything. She put the cup down and went over to him.</p>

<p>He wasn't moving. She was confused at first. But she quickly realized: he must have fallen asleep.</p>

<p>That was great! He had complained about not being able to sleep, so this must mean he was finally getting better! Yu smiled, and almost wanted to cry. It had been so long. Soon he would be healed, then they could go outside and play in the warm sun again.</p>

<p>She kept looking at his still body. <i>He looks so peaceful, </i>Yu thought to herself. She touched his face, feeling his soft, pale skin. It was cool, so his fever had gone down too.</p>

<p>Before she realized, her own face had moved closer to his, and her lips were touching his cheek, leaving a small kiss there. She moved back, thinking about how cold it really felt. Well... That wouldn't Â do. She should put the sheets back on him. Yeah, that's what she should do.</p>

<p>What she ended up doing, was crawling into the bed, on top of him. She was still keeping him warm. Just... With her body. Yeah.</p>

<p>She hugged him, and nuzzled her face against his. He still didn't move. He was sleeping really deeply, she guessed. She didn't want to disturb him. But she didn't want to move either. Touching him was nice. They hadn't been able to touch like this since he got sick. She was sure he wouldn't mind.</p>

<p>Mindlessly, Yu kept digging herself into his body, kissing his cheek. Without thought, her hands wandered, slipping under his clothes. The poor boy, he was cold all over, while she was feeling so warm. It wasn't quite fair.</p>

<p>"Sorry..." She whispered, as she pulled down his pants and underwear, just enough to reveal his crotch. She rubbed the small soft sack under his penis. She didn't have much of a goal on mind, just wanting to chase that tingling feeling inside.</p>

<p>Rei probably wouldn't approve, if he were awake. He might even scold her. But he wasn't awake right now. Right now Yu wanted to do this, have this new secret, just for herself.</p>

<p>She felt something near her own crotch, almost like she wanted to pee again, but it wasn't the same. Her free hand moved into her panties, and she shivered as her finger slipped between her lower lips. She touched the both of them softly, careful not to make any noise.</p>

<p>He still felt cold. She noticed it, but her head was fuzzy. She moved closer to him, as close as she could possibly get, letting there private parts touch each other. A warm liquid came out of her as she unconsciously rubbed against him. "S-sorry," she said again quietly, looking down and seeing the clear white fluid, different from pee. She was too tired to question it, she realized. She started to fall asleep beside him.</p>

<p>It had been a long time since they slept in the same bed. They used to do it all the time, when they were younger. Yu wondered now why they ever stopped. It felt so nice, being this close with her brother. She missed this. She missed him. But things would be ok, now that he was getting better.</p>

<p>Yu slept, and dreamt of her and Rei being together, for a long time.</p>
