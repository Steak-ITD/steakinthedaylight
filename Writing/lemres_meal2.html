                    <h3>PART 2 OF 2</h3>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> After writing the first one, I felt like continuing it rather immediately... it ended up with a hopeful ending at least. I really like thinking about the friendship Klug and Lemres shared in the past.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Something was definitely off with Lemres lately. Or maybe not lately, as Klug had always noticed some slightly strange things about him.</p>
<p>He never seemed to be very tired at night, even when they studied late. But he was rather avoidant in the morning, never wanting to go out too far if it was sunny. As such, he avoided other sources of heat too, never going near any fire, or using hot magic. He also avoids vegetables, sometimes picking at his food to ensure they weren't there.</p>
<p>Most of those things wouldn't have been so weird on their own. Maybe Lemres just had a weird internal clock, maybe he had a lot of allergies.</p>
<p>But then, a particularly egregious thing happened, that made Klug think. The two boys were playing in the rather small forest near their town. While returning home, Lemres tripped and fell onto a rock. He got up, and part of it had embedded itself into his cheek, making a rather nasty-looking gash. But he didn't seem to notice that, didn't seem to be in much pain at all. When Klug pointed it out, Lemres was confused for a moment before realizing he should be in pain at all. Still, he simply pulled the rock out and asked him not to worry.</p>
<p>The strange part though, was the next day. The gash had completely disappeared. Not even a scar was left behind. Again, when Klug pointed this out in shock, Lemres had looked blankly for a second, before hastily telling him he just healed it with magic...</p>
<p>Klug knew a thing or two about healing magic. There wasn't any that would heal *that thoroughly,* without even leaving a scar. Or if there was, they were both too young to have found it, much less performed it. He started to think maybe he missed something in his studies about dark magic, which was known to have powerful healing properties. Then, he remembered something else. A story about a creature that had (un)natural healing properties, that came out in the night and avoided the sunlight and its heat.</p>
<p>Could the story be true?</p>
<p>No, it was silly, right? He was jumping to conclusions too fast. Surely everything he thought of had a reasonable explanation, even the fast healing. Yet the thought wouldn't leave his head. He wanted to ask Lemres about it, but he probably wouldn't just tell him, if it were true.</p>
<p>Then, an idea crossed his mind when he thought of that injury. It was a naughty idea, a bad one even, but it got stuck in his head too. He would call it an experiment, and it was sure to answer his question.</p>
                    <img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" class="responsive" />
                    <p>A usual scenario; the two boys were hanging out together, and again it had started to get late. But this time, Klug was absolutely determined to stay awake! It wasn't working that well for him. Lemres was feeling just fine though.</p>
<p>Now was a good time to try the "experiment". He took a pen and looked at the sharp tip. It made him a bit nervous, so he took a breath, and stabbed his arm. While it was still in his arm, he pulled it across his skin. The cut began to bleed, just as planned.</p>
<p>"Haa... Hey, I cut myself by accident..." Klug said through his teeth. He did not expect it to hurt this much.</p>
<p>He looked over at Lemres, who was frozen in place. He had his hands gripped together tight. "...Oh. I'll go and get something to wrap it." He remained stiffly in place, staring at the cut.</p>
<p>They stayed like that for a few agonizing minutes.</p>
<p>"Lemres, are you ok?" Klug whispered, feeling very nervous all of a sudden.</p>
<p>"You should get out of here." Lemres whispered back.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I can't..." Lemres didn't finish. He sighed.</p>
<p>A glint appeared in his mouth. A glint in the moonlight, reminding Klug of his "dream". He was in awe at the sharp fangs, momentarily forgetting his nerves.</p>
<p>"You're... you're a vampire-"</p>
<p>He barely finished his thought before hearing a hiss and being pounced on. He struggled to get up after falling to the floor, but was pinned by the older boy. Lemres lifts Klug's bloody arm and licks almost feverishly. He bit into the wound, making Klug whimper in pain.</p>
<p>His mind was racing, he could hardly believe it was real, even though he was previously considering the possibility. Now it was really happening, he didn't know what to do, and that scared him. He closed his eyes and sobbed. This was such a bad idea.</p>
<p>When Lemres finished feeding, the wound no longer bled. He released his hold, but Klug didn't move. His eyes slowly opened to see a sad, horrified looking face on the verge of tears. He was just as scared.</p>
<p>"I-I-I'm so s-sorry," Lemres started, hardly able to speak through his shaking and crying.</p>
<p>Klug saw this, and he put his fear aside. He didn't need to be afraid. Despite everything, this was his friend. He never wanted to hurt him. He walked over to him. "No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have tried to pry."</p>
<p>Lemres looked up at Klug, trying to wipe his tears. He was thinking a lot too, but neither said anything for a while.</p>
<p>"I never wanted this to happen. I didn't want to taste blood. But then that night happened, and now, when I see it I can't control myself. I'm just like the rest of them now."</p>
<p>So that was the truth. Why his neck was really sore that morning. Klug didn't feel much of anything about it though, seeing his friend like this.</p>
<p>"Hey... It'll be ok, I think... Maybe we can find a way to help, so you don't have to anymore. We can research it together."</p>
<p>"You still want to be around me?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do. You're still you." Klug smiled, trying to comfort Lemres, who had finally stopped crying.</p>
<p>"Ok, yeah, let's do that," he said. Klug extended his hand, and Lemres took it, slowly getting up. They both realized they were pretty tired, so they decided to call it a night, and Lemres went back home.</p>
<p>Klug went to bed, still thinking of the events of the night. But now, he was feeling more confident. He wanted to help his friend. There had to be some way, he was sure. And they would find it together.</p>
