                    <h3>PART 1 OF 2</h3>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;">An old fanfiction where Bowser Jr.'s Clown Car really likes him... and is also actually alive? The only thing I ever wrote with multiple chapters. As in, 2 chapters. There was going to be a third, but I had no idea how to actually end this thing, and I moved on. Written 2014.</p>

                    <p>"It's just a machine," everyone told him. "It can't function by itself. It has no real emotions."</p><p>Only BJ knew the truth. That his Junior Clown Car was no ordinary vehicle. It was special, unlike any other machine he had ever used, and he treated it as such. He cherished this wonderful contraption.</p><p>But what he didn't know, is how much it cherished him.</p><p><img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" style="width:756px" /></p><p>"Well, time for me to go to bed," said Junior to his Clown Car. It made a sad expression. "Aw, don't worry, I'll be back tomorrow..." He started walking away, before turning back to the Clown Car. He smiled softly, and whispered, "Goonight."</p><p>The Clown Car sat there in the dark garage. Outside the small window was the night sky, illuminated by the light of a full moon. Clown Car looked out it as best as it could, while missing its dear master. The master, who came by everyday to visit, who took care of it, fought with it, and revered it. And when it was without master, it was miserable. So very miserable... the Clown Car never wanted master to go, but he did, every night. The Clown Car decided it would stay with master. Never leave him, ever. And nothing in the world would be able to separate them again...</p>

                    <p>It was around 1:15 A.M. Junior was sleeping deeply in his small yet comfy bed, dreaming of his favorite food, cookies. He dreamt of living in a world where literally everything else was made of cookies. But then his sweet sugary dream was abruptly interrupted by a loud whirring sound. It was quite loud, then grew softer, until it stopped alltogether. Junior opened his eyes, to see a sight that nearly made him jump from his bed. Looming over him, was his Clown Car.</p><p>"Clown Car? Uh... how did you get up here?" he said, nervously. The Clown Car simply beeped happily at seeing its master again. "Shhh! Quiet, or someone will hear you!" he scolded. "Look, you can't be here right now. You've gotta go back to the garage..."</p><p>The Clown Car whistled anxiously.</p><p>"...Really, you have to go now..."</p><p>It started to jitter.</p><p>"...I...I can't have you up here... p-please, stay calm."</p><p>The Clown Car began approaching Junior slowly, but he pushed it away. "...No. J-just..." His voice became stern. "...just get back downstairs, now. I mean it."</p><p>But the Clown Car wouldn't let anything in the world separate it and master, ever again. Even if it were master himself.</p><p>It made an angry expression. It stretched out its arms, alarming Junior. Then suddenly, they rushed toward him, its hands firmly grasping each side of Junior. Now he was terrified. "What are you doing?! Let go!" He tried to struggle from the Clown Car's grasp, but to no avail. So he tried yelling for help.</p><p>"Someone! Please help!"</p><p>One of the night watching guards heard his cries, and came rushing into his bedroom. "What did you scream fo-" she didn't need to finish, as she saw the Clown Car in the air, holding on tight to Junior.</p><p>It saw the guard, and knowing what she was there to do, it opened its mouth and placed Junior inside. Then it's hands changed into sharp drills, pointed toward the guard.</p><p>"Let the prince go!" the guard yelled. She threw her spear toward the Clown Car, only to have it dodge the spear which hit the window, breaking it. The Clown Car saw this as an opportunity to get away. It went through the hole, breaking the window even more. It flew off into the night, with its master in its mouth. The guard looked worriedly out the now shattered window. "Oh no."</p>

                    <p>In the night sky, the Clown Car flew about, beeping happily knowing now it could be with master forever. But Junior didn't feel the same way. He stared sadly into the distance, wondering what was to come of all this.</p>
