                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Requested by the guest Darkfox is lesbian action between Amitie and Ess. I hope you like how I went about it.</p>

                    <p>"You seem so stressed lately, Ess!" Amitie pointed out as soon as she found her.</p>

<p>Ess made a show of sighing really loudly. She WAS stressed, and Amitie's loud voice wasn't helping her headache. "What do you want!?"</p>

<p>"I want to help you out, of course," Amitie came closer, pitting her hands on Ess' shoulders. "How about a massage? I think I'm pretty good at it."</p>

<p>That didn't sound so bad, though Ess wasn't sure if Amitie had the precision or calm to do such a thing. She decided to try it out anyway. "Fine, but you'd better be careful."</p>

<p>"Yay! Lay on your stomach!" Ess complied, amd Amitie unzipped her clothing and began to rub her shoulders firmly. It actually felt rather good. Tension vanished from her body as Amitie moved further down her back. She let out a moan.</p>

<p>"Like it so far?" Amitie giggled.</p>

<p>"Mmm... Could you go lower?"</p>

<p>She does, and it feels so nice. Amitie's fingers are so soft, and they press into just the right spots. It was impressive.</p>

<p>Her hands even move down to Ess' butt, squeezing the flesh gently. She finds she doesn't mind; she did ask for her to go lower after all.</p>

<p>"Hey, Ess... Could I try something a little... special?" Amitie asked, showing a bit of nervousness.</p>

<p>"More special than this?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I wanna make you feel <i>really</i> good."</p>

<p>"Hmm..." Usually Ess would have been scandalized by the suggestion. But with the way Amitie's hands moved across her skin, she forgot all her woes. "Sure, go ahead."</p>

<p>Almost immediately, Amitie used one hand to spread Ess' cheeks open, and the other to rub against her pussy lips. Ess moans again, longer this time. She was still being massaged, now in a more sensitive area, making it feel all the more wonderful.</p>

<p>She turned on her back when Amitie asked, so she could give her better access. Amitie took the opportunity to slip her clothes down her shoulders and reach for Ess' breast, squeezing and rubbing much like she did with her behind. She took the nipple into her fingers and massaged it as well. At the same time, she found Ess' clit and gently pinched it, causing her to squeal. So much stimulation; it felt exciting and peaceful at once.</p>

<p>This went on for a few minutes. Amitie made impeccable movements across Ess' breasts, and rubbed her clit in smooth circular motions. Ess realized just how much she had needed touches like this. She soon reached her peak, humming as it came over her like a cool but sharp breeze.</p>

<p>"There ya go! I bet you feel much less stress now, huh?" Amitie had her usual big goofy smile on.</p>

<p>"I do. How did you get so good at that?"</p>

<p>"I dunno, practice I guess!"</p>

<p>"Well, next, I want to give <i>you</i> a massage."</p>

<p>"Really?" Amitie blushed.</p>

<p>"I may not be able to move like you, but I have plenty of lovely lotions that would make you feel heavenly." Ess grinned, and her eyes became half lidded. "What do you say?"</p>

<p>Amitie nodded her head furiously in response. This was going to be a fun night.</p>
