                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Requested by Guesy, a sequel to Amitie streaking, in which she gets caught.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Amitie squealed to herself as she took off the last of her clothes. She was really going to do this... She was going to go outside naked again. But this time on purpose!</p>

                    <p>The last time it happened was a disaster, but not all bad, and that day kept replaying in her mind. The thrill of running around, trying not to get caught. This time, she knew where her clothes were, hidden away from any animals, so she didn't have to worry.</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally, she stepped out of her home. It was hot outside, but being nude she didn't feel too sweaty. She began sneaking around, looking closely for any passersby. She dashed from bush to bush, sign to sign, finding poses that would hide her enough from view.</p>
                    
                    <p>Occasionally someone looked in her direction. She was well hidden enough that they didn't notice her or her state of undress, probably. Amitie giggled when they continued on. She felt a fun kind of nervousness, like being on a ride.</p>
                    
                    <p>Her hopping and skipping through town eventually led her into the woods. Feeling sufficiently hidden by the shade of the trees, she relaxed and let out a sigh. Amitie felt proud of herself. She didn't trip a single time, or get too distracted. Everything had gone perfectly...</p>
                    
                    <p>"Amitie, is that you?"</p>
                    
                    <p>She heard a voice behind her. A familiar voice. Oh dear. She slowly turned around to see Sig looking her over. Her face became red. She got caught, and in such an unlikely place too!</p>
                    
                    <p>"Oh, hey, Sig...!" She said, trying to act casually. "What, uh, what are you doing here?"</p>
                    
                    <p>"Looking for a dragonfly," he replied, pointing at a picture of one in his hand. "What are you doing naked?"</p>
                    
                    <p>How to play this off... "Am I? I didn't notice. With the, um, weather and all being so hot, you know?"</p>
                    
                    <p>They stood in silence for a minute, both trying to avoid the other's gaze.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Ok," Sig said after the agonizing minute. "...Get home safe." He turned around rather quickly and walked away.</p>
                    
                    <p>Amitie exhaled shakily. That was embarrassing. And she had no idea if Sig was actually convinced by her excuse. At least he didn't question it further. Her heart was still racing. Perhaps with excitement, perhaps with anxiety. Either way her energy was still high.</p>
                    
                    <p>This was just poor timing, a coincidence. She had made it this far, she could get back home again without getting caught. She didn't have to worry. With her confidence back, she left the woods and continued sneaking around, successfully returning home without incident.</p>
