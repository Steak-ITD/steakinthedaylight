                    <p>The small room was a mess. Pieces of broken furniture and ripped cloth strewn about; the carpet was stained in various reds.&nbsp;</p><p>"What happened in here? Where's Sonic?" Knuckles yelled.</p>
<p>Tails didn't reply. He kept staring at the wall.</p>
<p>Impatient, Knuckles yelled again, "Answer me! What happened!?"</p>
<p>"I begged," he said, voice low.</p>
<p>"Begged...?"</p>
<p>"I begged, pleaded with him to run away. Told him I couldn't control myself anymore," he intoned. "But he wouldn't listen to me. He stayed."</p>
<p>He moves for the first time in hours, looking down at his hands.</p>
<p>"He said, 'I won't abandon you.'"</p>
<p>Carpeted in red, dotted with blue.</p>
<p>"He was a great friend."</p>
