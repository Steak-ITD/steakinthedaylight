                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Some context, this takes place in an AU where Lemres is the younger one in Sig and his relationship, and he met Salde not too long ago, inspiring him to leave his home, among other things.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Lemres looked at the door. His hand hovers over the handle, then lowers to the wood below. "I don't..." he says softly.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Sig had been watching him leave but noticed his hesitation. He heard him say something, but it was too low.</p>
<p>He turns around, looking at his face, just below his eyes. "I don't want to leave," he starts again, louder this time. "I want to stay here with you."</p>
<p>Sig is surprised by his boldness. The teen was usually so nervous and fidgeting. Now he stood still and strong. He was kind of proud, but..."Your family...?"</p>
<p>"I don't care anymore. I left. Now I-I'm... they can chase me all they want but I'm going to live my w-way," he stuttered through his words, but he had done it. He declared his freedom. He kept going, trying not to shake more out of nervousness. "I want to make as many people as happy as I c-can with my magic! And my sweets! And, and...!"</p>
<p>"Lem," Sig put his hand on Lemres' shoulder to stop his shaking. "I get it." He smiled.</p>
<p>"...and, I want to see people smile. I want to see you smile." Lemres blushed and looked down. He put his hand on the one on his shoulder. "I love the way you smile."</p>
<p>That smile widened just a bit. He thought it was so handsome. Before he knew it, the two were very close to each other. Lemres had grown taller pretty quickly, and now his face was almost even with Sig's. They could feel each other's breath. He wanted to move just a bit closer, so badly, but his nerves...</p>
<p>Sig must have noticed, because he did lean in ever so slightly, they nearly touched. "You should smile too," he whispered.</p>
<p>*That's it*, he thought. *If I could escape, then I can go for this too*. Despite his anxiety, he finally closed the short distance between them. Their lips together felt so warm, so right. His arms slowly moved around the other's neck, pulling him deeper into their kiss. It was soft, but not as smooth as he hoped, still being inexperienced.</p>
<p>He eventually leaned back and let his eyes open. Sig looked for a second before his own darted away. Neither were sure what to do now; they were still extraordinarily close to each other. Lemres once again broke their distance, this time leaning into the other's chest. "I want to stay with you," he repeated.</p>
<p>Sig hugs him, listening to his low but quick breaths. "Ok," he says, and rubs the other's back, calming him down.</p>
<p>"Thank you..."</p>
