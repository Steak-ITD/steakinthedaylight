                    <p>Pico didn't get what was so interesting with his tongue. Whenever Beta kissed him, he would pay particular attention to that, playing around with it using his own. Not that he complained. Admittedly, he also enjoyed feeling Beta's flat, bumpy tongue against his long, slender one.</p>

<p>Beta liked pulling it out Pico's mouth, holding it between them like spaghetti. Pico deadpanned when he did this. But one night, he sucked on it, gently pushing it against the roof of his mouth. Pico's eyes widened at the sensation, the *taste*. He quickly slipped his tongue back in, moaning while Beta giggled.</p>
