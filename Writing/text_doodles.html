                    <h2><img src=/Asset/T.png width=36 /> What is a Dream but a Shattered Memory (Friday Night Funkin)</h2>
                     <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> This was based on a very odd dream I had. I was practically describing the events again, from the perspective of Girlfriend. It's the first time I tried writing a story in second-person POV, and it was actually quite interesting trying to describe stagnation and sensory deprivation as you go through a repetitive experience. I got pretty far into this one before other stuff took my interest. it was going to end with her finding a mangled, distorted Boyfriend in a room filled with blue light. He would reach out to her and she would be frozen in fear, which she isn't used to, then wake up confused and tired.</p>
                    <p>You feel like you've been walking forever. it probably hasn't been more than an hour. but time was always weird in places like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This hallway went on and on. There was nothing to see but walls with doors. All empty, all locked. There was no noise, other than an air filter from nowhere, and your own footsteps. The lights were a warm, dirty yellow, matching the pale yellow of the walls, and complimenting the red and green speckled carpet below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was it. Nothing to do but walk, since all the doors were locked. It just made you sad, the lack of any kind of activity. You thought about humming to get rid of the dullness, but it didn't help. The echo only made you feel more lonely. So you just keep walking forward, occasionally looking side to side. Usually, the monotony would frustrate you. But this time, it only makes you feel empty. It even gives you a sense of "dread". ...Just push it back into your mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the time something changes, you feel numb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lights above begin to flicker, making a sound to match. As numb as your senses were, that was enough to get you to stop walking and look up. They flickered as if the earth was shaking, but you didn't feel anything. Once it stops, you look back in front of you. To your surprise, something else is different. One light up ahead stayed off. Not a very big change, but by this point, any change in the scenery was welcomed. You walk over to the light, a bit faster than usual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Underneath the broken bulb, you notice another light. Blue, instead of the rotting yellow. Your eyes follow it to see that it's coming from the door to your left. The light glowed from underneath the door, and through its small glass window. You grab the knob and turn it. It moves. This door was actually unlocked! You feel excited. A different light, a different feeling from everything else around here. Maybe something fun was behind this door! New sounds, maybe a new song? The more you imagined, the more excited you felt. You open the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blue light is much brighter inside. It surrounds the entire room but it doesn't have a source. The walls are a bit ornate, having a pattern in between and towards the ceiling. In the middle of the room is a plain-looking bed. Something dark covered the white sheets. You think it might be red, but it's hard to tell with the blue light. You look to the middle of the bed to find the source of the color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dread fills you again.</p>

                     <h2><img src=/Asset/E.png width=36 /> Catharsis (Friday Night Funkin)</h2>
                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Rough M/M sex, dubious consent</p>
                     <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> The idea behind this was Boyfriend taking out his frustration about his relationship with Pico out on him, on his prompting. He ends up being a lot rougher than he realizes, learning something about himself. It would progress from him not realizing how rough he's being, to finally seeing it, and then accepting it. I started from the middle for this, because I tend to have issues with beginning and setting up stories... and eventually I lost interest in this as I couldn't find the proper words.</p>
                    <p>Once he calmed down, he moved away from his face. A long, thick trail of spit connected his cock to the other's mouth. He looked down at him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This bruised, coughing mess of a man lay before him. It was so different from what he was used to, what he was doing. He was tough, and confident and would never back down from a fight. Now here he was, barely conscious, covered in mostly his own bodily fluids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He looked weak. Pathetic. And so... <em>attractive</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was because of him. He had done this, reduced someone like him to this pitiable state. Because he had let him. He had underestimated him. The frustration built up inside. He hadn't expected what he could do, what he *wanted* to do. He couldn't help but find it a bit funny, how neither of them had expected this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He laughed. "You know, I don't think you've ever looked better." He felt himself getting hard again, just looking at him, thinking how he must feel. He didn't respond. Perhaps he was too winded to say anything. Or maybe he had nothing to say. It didn't matter either way. He giggled again, and slowly leaned down towards the tired boy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He stroked himself to become fully erect. Once he was&nbsp; [AND THAT'S WHERE IT ENDS. I NEVER FINISHED THIS SENTENCE DUDE]</p>

                     <h2><img src=/Asset/E.png width=36 /> A Nibble of Indulgence (Friday Night Funkin Minus)</h2>
                     <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> So Minus Pico goes over to Beta Boyfriend's house because he's been thinking about him a lot, and like, they talk about stuff, they end up fucking, Pico gets very into it and bites Beta really hard on his shoulder as he comes. Then Pico comes down from his high and instantly regrets, going to the bathroom to get stuff to stop the bleeding. They talk about what just happened, promising to be a bit more careful next time. Eh. I guess I have the synopsis outlined, but I'm just not into writing for these characters right now.</p>
                    <p>He really should just go home. It wasn't that far from here. That's what Pico tried to tell himself, as he stood in front of the window of Beta's apartment. How fortunate for him that it was on the first floor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had been out all day doing work, in this cold dreary, rainy weather. He was stressed, and he was freezing, and that wasn't good for a reptile. But, here was a warm place, a warm body... he didn't even know if Beta was home. He did forget to turn his lamp off often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had been on Pico's mind a lot lately. Weirdly so, to him. Lately, he seemed to fixate on all these small aspects of him, his voice, his smile, his scent. They were stuck in his head. It made him feel... hungry, in a sense. That wasn't too strange to feel about his boyfriend, wasn't it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But still, he found himself longing for that warmth. Surely, just because he was freezing right now. His claws scratched the glass. He sighed. Guess he may as well take the chance. He knocked on the glass and waited.</p>

                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Implied vore. Would have been straight up oral regenerative vore had I finished it.</p>
                     <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Remember the <a href="https://steakinthedaylight.neocities.org/Gallery/first_snake.html">picture I drew of Boyfriend being eaten by a snake</a>? Well. This would have been the sequel, in which we find out Girlfriend is the purple snake. We learn about my extremely nonsensical and self indulgent AU in which BF and GF transform into snakes and eat each other for fun in a grassy field. Why? Because I said so. Told ya it'd get weirder.</p>
                    <p>Girlfriend woke up on a green, grassy hill. The sun shone brightly overhead, its heat enough to keep her warm, even without any of her clothing. Still drowsy from what must have been a long slumber, she slowly shifted around, wondering if she was alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She found herself leaning against something else warm, yet dry. Glancing over, she saw a long snake, bright blue scales shimmering in the daylight, offset by darker blue stripes. It lay still, it's only movement being steady, slow breaths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She remembered now. Last night, she had been in the same form.</p>

                    <p>This night... it was supposed to be a peaceful night. She had just wanted to spend some alone time with her partner. The town they walked in didn't seem all that dangerous. And even if it was, it wouldn't be such a big deal. [adebabdeba that's all folks]</p>

                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> vore but just in the notes</p>
                     <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> This would have been based on <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/vorishprompts/173382303546/character-a-is-a-monster-living-on-the-outskirts">a prompt from a vore blog on tumblr</a>. It would star a Joltik and a Corvisquire. The Joltik would be on a journey to defeat it, only to find Corvisquire is actually a nice guy. Eventually the rest of the town tries to kill Corvi and he eats Joltik temporarily to scare them off. This ends up ruining their friendship. I thought it would be an interesting way to use vore in a story that's simply about a friendship. I never started the story, but I outlined it in full.</p>
                    <ul>
<li>Joltik goes to the home of a giant bird, hoping for an adventure. He plans to defeat this apparent menace to his hometown.</li>
<li>The Corvisquire lives up on a hill. He is introverted and greets Joltik skittishly.</li>
<li>Joltik is confused about how shy the bird seems to be and wants to talk.</li>
<li>Corvi lets him in and explains he's not very outgoing like the rest of his kind. He prefers to stay in and write.</li>
<li>Joltik is curious about his writing and Corvi explains they are adventure stories based on the places he used to travel.</li>
<li>joltik enjoys stories like these, and the two bond over their shared interest and write together.</li>
<li>Corvi gains the confidence to go outside again and explore more places and create more stories.</li>
<li>The spider community sees Corvi flying and assume he is out hunting, believing their village will be next.</li>
<li>They decide to sacrifice one of their own to get the bird to leave them alone.</li>
<li>Joltik volunteers, secretly to prove Corvi isn't dangerous.</li>
<li>They get to the hill. Corvi comes out and freezes in panic at all the electric spiders.</li>
<li>Joltik whispers to Corvi to show them he isn't dangerous, but Corvi suddenly eats him.</li>
<li>Corvi declares the "sacrifice" to be "worthy" enough, trying to sound bold and struggling to hide his stutter.</li>
<li>When the spiders leave to celebrate, Corvi spits Joltik out.</li>
<li>Joltik is upset about what Corvi did. It terrified him. Corvi explains he panicked and just wanted the spiders to go away, and apologizes profusely.</li>
<li>joltik is still upset because he can't go home after everyone thinks he's dead, lest they harass Corvi. Corvi offers for him to stay, but Joltik doesn't want to after what happened.</li>
<li>Corvi apologizes again. now Joltik is just sad he broke his trust. he leaves for somewhere unknown.</li>
