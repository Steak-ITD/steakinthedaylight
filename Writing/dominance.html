                    <hr>
                    <p>On a hot summer day, in the middle of the city, the sounds of gunshots reverberated through the air. Two people were fighting in the streets; one, a ginger-haired young man, the other, a green-scaled young dinosaur. Both going by the name Pico. Somehow, two versions of the same soul, together in one place.</p><p> </p><p>Neither of them were very happy about it. So they decided to settle things the best way they knew how: violence.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed like they were evenly matched. For some time, neither of them were able to best each other. However, the high temperature of summer was putting one of the combatants at a disadvantage. Being a cold-blooded reptile, staying in the heat too long was exhausting the dinosaur much quicker than usual. He tried not to let his rival notice it, but it was getting harder to keep up.</p><p> </p><p>Before he could move in time, Pico managed to get a  good shot on Dino; right where he was holding his gun, knocking it out of his hand. He quickly went to get it, as fast as he could, but as he got back up, he found a gun pointed at his head.</p><p> </p><p>Pico had a smug look on his face. "What's the matter, lizard? Can't handle the heat?" he jeered, wiping the sweat off his brow.</p><p> </p><p>Dino snarled back at him. So he had noticed after all. He glared into Pico's eyes, meanwhile moving his tail closer to the other's ankle. Once it was close enough, he wrapped it around, and pulled it back towards himself, tripping up Pico and leading him to hit the ground on his back, dropping his own gun. </p><p> </p><p>After getting back up, Dino stood over his twin, who was trying to recover from the fall. As he should be. No way he was going to be stood up by some human copy of himself. He could beat him any day. Look at how easily he'd gotten the upper hand. He didn't even need his guns to do it, either! He had his tail, of course, and his sharp teeth, and...</p><p> </p><p>He had an idea. Why not show him another one of the tricks he had up his sleeve? He grinned, imagining his opponent's shock once he'd started.</p><p> </p><p>"Surprised you, didn't I?" Dino bent over. "You just got a lucky shot. But I don't need guns to take you down." He got closer to the other's face. "I have other weapons in my arsenal."</p><p> </p><p>Pico, still dizzy and dazed from hitting the hard pavement, just barely heard what he said. Rubbing his head, he muttered "Yeah? Like wha-" As he looked up, he was somewhat confused at what he was seeing; rows of razor-sharp teeth, a long, inhuman tongue dripping with saliva, and behind it, a dark, wet tunnel. Before he could fully react, that view came down on him, his head surrounded by that wet darkness. Then he felt his arms grabbed by the sides, and the rest of his body being lifted into the air. All this served to confuse him even more. Only after hearing the slippery sound of a gulp did he fully comprehend what was actually happening.</p><p> </p><p>"Huh!? What the- I- w-what!?" he sputtered, too dumbfounded at first to feel angry. Dino chuckled (as much as he could with an entire person in his mouth) at his reaction. It was exactly what he'd expected. He swallowed again, Pico now up to his chest in Dino's throat.</p><p> </p><p>Now furious, he struggles to no avail, his surroundings too tight to move around in. So he settled for kicking his still exposed legs around, trying anything he could to stop this somehow. Dino just responds by grabbing his shoes and pulling them off. Then he just pushes him in deeper, gulping more, the human now knee-deep into the dark tunnel.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, with one last big gulp, Pico disappears completely down Dino's throat, and into his waiting stomach. It wasn't quite as tight as his throat, but it still squeezed him uncomfortably, forcing him into a curled position. He could barely move his limbs a few inches from his body without the squishy walls pushing him back. That didn't stop him from kicking and punching around, in rage and a hint of panic.</p><p> </p><p>Dino looked down at his hugely distended belly, smirking at seeing the bumps and bulges from the struggles of the man inside, despite the slight discomfort it caused. He sighed in a bit of relief. Swallowing someone only slightly shorter than himself had been quite an ordeal. Usually, he would tear his targets apart before devouring them, but he figured doing it this way would be more humiliating for his counterpart, and he was not dissatisfied. He poked his finger into his squishy belly, guessing where Pico's head would be, and jeered, "Well? What do you think? Pretty devastating "weapon", huh?"</p><p> </p><p>Pico was having none of it. "Shut UP. What is wrong with you!?" he yelled, trying hard not to let any of the fear he felt come through in his voice. He wouldn't give him that. He kept kicking, only covering himself in more of the stomach's fluids. It somehow felt both slippery and still tight.</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing that isn't wrong with you," Dino replied. "I could have done much worse, trust me."</p><p> </p><p>"W-when I get out of here. <em>I'll </em>do something much worse...!" Pico was beginning to feel light-headed, slowing down his struggles, the lowering amount of oxygen and the slight sting of the acids finally getting to him.</p><p> </p><p>Dino chuckled again. "Mmhmm, I'd like to see you try..." He yawned. He was feeling pretty tired after all the fighting and eating. Plus, it was still pretty hot out. Perhaps it was time to find a better place to revel in his victory. He picked up his guns and started to walk away. It was a bit difficult with the new weight in his belly but still manageable. He departed from the city streets, leaving only a gun and a pair of shoes.</p>
