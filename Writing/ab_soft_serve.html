        <p>Amy stared into the dark cavern of Bark's throat, entranced by the way it moved with each breath. She glanced down at his teeth. They glistened with saliva, sharp like any good hunter's, or protector's, should be.</p>
<p>She rested her arms on his warm tongue, signaling him to push her in deeper. He eagerly begins swallowing her. Perhaps a little too fast, as he started to gag on her head. She giggled at his excitement and lowered her quills to make it easier for him. He kept pushing her in until her whole body was in her mouth. Once done, he tilted his head back and took a large gulp, letting her slide down his throat.</p>
<p>Amy sighed peacefully being pulled by Bark's throat. Landing in his stomach, she leans against the soft walls and listens to his steady heartbeat. Bark sighs as well, rubbing his belly and relishing in the feeling of being full.</p>
