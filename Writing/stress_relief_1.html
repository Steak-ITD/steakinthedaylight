                    <hr>
                    <p>Girlfriend hated being tied up like this.</p>

<p>It was like being stuck in a tiny room while still outside, freedom seemingly just in reach. But her upper body was restrained.</p>

<p>She couldn't move away to a better place. She couldn't get away from the creatures toying with her clothes. She could only struggle while they held her flailing legs. She could only shudder as a dry finger slowly rubbed against her vagina.</p>

<p>"This is all it takes to get you wet?" They mocked. "What a pathetic demon."</p>

<p>She sobbed and closed her eyes. She was unable to do anything else.</p>
