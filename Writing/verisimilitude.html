                    <p>Pico continued thrusting into Boyfriend, keeping a steady pace. He stared into his face, watching his every little movement. His hands gripped his sides, almost hard enough to bruise. He listened intently to his high, melodic voice, sounding like a song. (He thought he heard him say his name). </p><p>He took every sensation in, awestruck. Amazed that this sight, this person before him was real… he felt completely in this moment. He almost didn’t want it to end. This feeling of being grounded in reality, in ecstasy. As he reached his climax, Pico clung a bit tighter to his partner.</p>
