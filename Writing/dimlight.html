                    <p><em>Now where could that boy have gone? </em>It was getting dark outside, and Lemres was beginning to worry. Sig had gone off on his own somewhere. Perhaps he didn't <em>have </em>to be so concerned, the youth demon was quite powerful, but he couldn't help it. Being alone might still be dangerous for someone like him, especially since again night was falling...</p>

<p>...as he came across the local forest, a sound reached Lemres' ears. Somebody was sobbing. He gasped despite himself, and his chest tightened. What if Sig really was hurt!? He rushed as fast as he could towards the sound. Finally he reached a clearing in the woods; a grassy place where the sun could shine in the daytime. Now during night, it was covered in small moving lights; fireflies. In the middle of the area was the source of the crying. Sig was indeed here, curled into himself crying.</p>

<p>Lemres went over to him as fast as he could within surprising him too much. "What's wrong? Are you ok?" he said a bit too fast.</p>

<p>Sig looked up towards him, his eyes puffy and red. Then he held out one of his claws and opened it slowly. Inside was a dimming yellow glow.</p>

<p>"Ah," Lemres sighed in relief. But still he felt for Sig. He knew how much the young demon loved any and all bugs. No wonder he was so distressed. He sat down next to him and gently put his hand on his shoulder. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Sig leaned away from the touch and sniffed, looking down at his hand again. "Why am I such a monster?" he weeped.</p>

<p>"You're not a monster," Lemres replied. "You just have to be more careful then most... I know you didn't mean to hurt anything."</p>

<p>"What if I can't? What if I hurt someone else, like you, or Akuma, or my friends?"</p>

<p>"I know you won't, Sig. Because you're too kind and caring. We all know that you would never really harm us." Lemres held out his hand, this time letting Sig initiate a touch.</p>

<p>And he did, putting his claw in his hand. They both stood up together, and just watched the other fireflies for a bit. Then Sig leaned down, placing the dead firefly on the ground as gently as possible. He looked back up at Lemres, a small smile on his face. "Thank you," he said softly.</p>

<p>"You're welcome. Come, let's go home. I'll make you anything you want to feel better, ok?" Lemres smiled back. Sig nodded, and the two of them walked back into the forest.</p>
