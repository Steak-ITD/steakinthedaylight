</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	A subdued, stoic person. They have trouble expressing their emotions
	physically. Much of their expressions appear very similar, and so
	most people can&rsquo;t tell how they&rsquo;re feeling from looking
	at them, except those close to them such as their father.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They are aware they can&rsquo;t express much visually. But they&rsquo;re
	still hurt by the implication that they can&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They don&rsquo;t know the difference between an ally and a friend.
	Most of the people they knew in their life were simply working
	towards common goals. They hadn&rsquo;t formed any true bonds
	between others besides their father.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They don&rsquo;t talk very much. When they do, their speech sounds
	somewhat monotonous, and is short, blunt, and to the point.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They also don&rsquo;t pick up on social cues well. They wouldn&rsquo;t
	figure out if someone was flirting with them for example (unless
	they happen to reciprocate the feelings&hellip;)</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They hardly ever lie. If they don&rsquo;t know or remember something
	they will say so. Although in some cases people don&rsquo;t believe
	them.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They are ruthless in battle. Being particularly skilled with swords.
	Although not quite quick on their feet they are physically strong.
	They continue to work hard with training.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	Fighting as a mercenary is all they have known, so they are largely
	unaware of the state of the continent&rsquo;s affairs.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They are surprisingly impulsive. They have a tendency to rush into
	battle, not focusing on anything else, appearing emotionless in the
	process. They don&rsquo;t seem to fear death. It gets them into
	trouble sometimes&hellip;</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	Outside of battle they usually or say the first thing that comes
	into their mind.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They can tell what people&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses are with
	careful observation. With enemy observation they are a bit more
	quick to pick out weak spots.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	However, they aren&rsquo;t as talented with tactics as others make
	them out to be. Part of this perception comes from their use of
	Divine Pulse, so often it may seem like they know when something is
	going to happen because they do. Even still, they don&rsquo;t always
	utilize this ability as best they could. They are better with
	thinking in the moment than with thinking ahead.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	Sometimes while talking to others they may get focused on odd little
	details.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They genuinely enjoy helping and listening to other people. Their
	expression noticeably lights up when feeding animals.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They like to be trusted and to be able to trust others. They take
	betrayal very personally and is very unlikely to forgive such
	actions.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They have noticed the strange things about themselves (having no
	heartbeat, lack of emotion, healing when damaging others). They do
	not really like their moniker. It makes them seem inhuman.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	They don&rsquo;t seem to think as highly of themself as others do.
	They tend to brush off compliments or their feats.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
	Another thing they enjoy is food and eating. Cooking a successful
	meal is also something that noticeably brings up their mood. Fishing
	is a hobby they get from their father.</p>
