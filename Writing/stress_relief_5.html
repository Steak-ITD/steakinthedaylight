                    <p>"It wasn't so bad, was it?" Pico said once he got up. Boyfriend's eyes were shut. He was sniffling. </p>

<p>Pico sighed and got off the bed to clean himself. Shortly after, he heard a whimper. "Why..."</p>

<p>He didn't look back. "Why...?"</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't you s-stop...?" Boyfriend had started crying again. </p>

<p>Pico sighed again. He was being dramatic. He'd wanted this. He couldn't just change his mind in the middle, right?</p>

<p>He kept telling himself that. He wouldn't be sad forever. He would still trust him.</p>

<p>He turned back around, but Boyfriend shrank into the sheets. "No... don't come any closer."</p>
