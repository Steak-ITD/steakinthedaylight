                    <hr>
                    <p>"Uhhnnn..."</p><p>Junior woke to find himself atop a cliff. "Wha... how'd I get here...?" He heard a whirring noise behind him. He turned around to find his kidnapper hovering about. "You... took me..." he said tiredly.</p><p>Clown Car looked at him with an innocent smile, acting as if it did nothing. Junior walked up to it. "...Why?" Clown Car came closer to him. "Is it because I told you to go?" Clown Car stretched out it's arms. It looked directly into his eyes. He could see it's loneliness.</p><p>"C'mon, don't be like that." He held Clown Car's hands. "I'm not gonna just leave you forever." He climbed up into it, and laid down. "Remember that." He curled up, trying to be as comfortable as possible. Eventually, he fell soundly asleep in his special copter.</p><p>Clown Car smiled as its master slept. It didn't believe it had done anything wrong before; it only wanted the only person who understood it not to go. Now it realized he wouldn't.</p><p>"I'm not gonna just leave you..."</p><p>The words resonated with it as it fell into sleep mode.

                    <p>"WHAT happened to him?!" Bowser yelled at the night guard, ticked off at being awoken in the night.</p><p>"Okay I'll try to explain it in a way that... makes sense," said the night guard. "Um. Your youngest son was kidnapped by a feral helicopter. There! Makes sense right?" She smiled weakly.</p><p>The grumpy tired king crassed his arms. "No, missy, it doesn't make any sense." He sigh loudly and shook his head. "Go find it..."</p><p>"Find it? How?"</p><p>Bowser glared at her. "How? Oh I dunno, how. Maybe ask people if they saw a flying helicopter pass by in the night?!"</p><p>"Oooh! Of course! Very smart!" She looked around a bit. "...right now?"</p><p>"Oh, for...YES, RIGHT NOW!!"</p><p>"Right now! Okay! I will find them!" She saluted and started running off.</p><p>Bowser shouted to her as she ran, "And when you find them, make sure that machine is destroyed!"</p><p>"No problem! I'll reduce that thing to scrap metal!"</p>

                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> So, this whole story about the Junior Clown Car being alive came from the fact that Bowser Jr. is in it a lot, and it emotes more individually than Bowser's Clown Car. But looking back, it is a really weird story. Plus, I never actually finished it. I kind of wrote it as I went along, and I hit a writer's block after chapter 2. I don't intend to finish it now, but I wouldn't mind someone else trying to, or even rewriting it.</p>
