<!--<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p> -->
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Some notes about
this:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>It is written
	with Japanese Classic lore in mind. I consider Classic and Modern to
	be separate dimensions/universes because of their clashing
	stylizations and tones. Most of this could be applicable to
	Modern.</p>
	<li><p>My approach to
	making head canons is mostly-canon-compliant. This is why I didn&rsquo;t
	make this with that much Modern lore in mind, because the canon is very
	wishy-washy there, and it&rsquo;s really difficult for me to be
	definitive with it.</p>
	<li><p>Some of this is
	<i>loosely</i> inspired by parts of
	<a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13654735/2/">this document.</a>
	The author has encouraged adaptation of their ideas for
	other interpretations, and I took interest in this chapter in
	particular.</p>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3>Personality</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Endlessly curious and always willing to learn about something
	new. When he becomes interested in a new topic, he will spend a long
	time gathering as much information as he can about it until he feels
	satisfied.  He can grasp new concepts more easily than other people.
	He is uncomfortable not knowing something.</p>
	<li><p>He has a very strong memory and is able to recall a lot of
	information about something upon being asked. 
	</p>
	<li><p>He gets lost in his thoughts frequently. Often becoming
	detached from what&rsquo;s going on around him, particularly when
	busy with a task or by himself. It becomes more pronounced when he
	gets more stressed.</p>
	<li><p>He is very talkative. When he&rsquo;s interested in
	something, he can talk at length about it easily. He doesn&rsquo;t
	usually realize how long he&rsquo;s been talking. He also asks a lot
	of questions. As a part of his wandering mind he might get caught on
	a particular detail and tangent about it.</p>
	<li><p>He&rsquo;s very resourceful and detail-oriented. He can find
	new ways to use unlikely objects, or analyze details about a given
	situation to figure out how to control it and/or solve the problem.</p>
	<li><p>He finds comfort in stability and control. This is part of
	the reason he enjoys being around and creating vehicles and
	machines. Being in an unknown or out of hand situation is stressful
	for him, it is a trigger for him getting lost in his thoughts as he
	tries to figure out how to stabilize his current situation. He is
	not a fan of random 
	</p>
	<li><p>Being incredibly intelligent, and due to isolation, he has
	trouble relating to others around him. He is not very aware or good
	with average socialization or ques, his talkative nature is a part
	of this.</p>
	<li><p>He is a highly rational minded individual. He is more willing
	to do questionable or violent things if he thinks it would be the
	best and/or only solution to a problem at hand. He is not
	particularly fond of doing these things and harbors guilt over it,
	but he doesn&rsquo;t feel right not doing what he finds to be
	logical either.</p>
	<li><p>He is incredibly resilient. Always driven to accomplish his
	goals, and to survive in general. But he doesn&rsquo;t give himself
	much credit for this aspect of himself. He learns more and more not
	to let his fears hold him back, but to drive him to do better.</p>
	<li><p>He is kind and selfless. He wants to help those around him
	and preserve peace. It is a motivation to some of his inventions.
	Even to those whom have wronged him he tries not to harbor
	resentment or bitterness (it doesn&rsquo;t always work). He does not
	like to hurt others unless he feels like it is absolutely necessary
	to solve a situation.</p>
</ul>
<h4>Mental health</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>He has had a lonely and downright harsh childhood, being
	isolated from others as well as put into life threatening situations
	where he had only himself. He has symptoms of post traumatic stress.
	He periodically has flashbacks and nightmares about events from his
	past. Large amounts of fire cause him to panic as it reminds him
	about what happened on Cocoa Island.</p>
	<li><p>Unfortunately,  his mind wanders to these thoughts and
	memories in a rumination fashion, which bothers him a lot when he&rsquo;s
	unable to stop. He tries to keep himself occupied to prevent this,
	but it doesn&rsquo;t always work. 
	</p>
	<li><p>He has low self esteem and persistent symptoms of depression,
	as a result of isolation, bullying and a bit of perfectionism. He
	tends to downplay his positive traits and accomplishments while
	accentuating the negative. This gets better as he finds real friends
	but is still always there. It affects his sleeping and eating
	habits; he tends to forget his appetite, and his sleeping patterns
	are very sporadic; issues he has already that are exacerbated by his
	mental state.</p>
</ul>
<h4>Bullying</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>He was bullied for his twin tails mainly by other foxes, who were vain and thought his defect ruined their "image". He was called a freak, a weirdo, even creepy by others. The teasing confuses him; he doesn't understand why they hate him so much.</p>
	<li><p>Others would step on his tails, getting them dirty or intentionally tripping him, them blaming it on him. He tries to hide one of his tails as a result, but it doesn't work as they're also quite big.</p>
	<li><p>No one around him seemed to care much for his inventions and gadgets. For a time, it causes him to underplay his own skill when someone does show interest.</p>
	<li><p>So used to being called by his nickname, he introduces himself to Sonic as "Tails", and wonders later why he did this.</p></li>
	<li><p>He is still affected by the bullying to this day, and isn't completely comfortable with being called by his nickname by other people besides his friends. Hearing the words he was called can bring back bad memories.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Relationships</h4>
<blockquote><b>
	Work in progress!!!</b></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>He looks up to Sonic's lack of care of what anyone thinks of him. Tails finds it to be so different from himself.</p></li>
<li><p>Sonic likes to build Tails up with compliments, which he isn't used to (he considers his work on the Tornado to be no big deal at first). Sonic also notices his general nervousness and assures him he really cares about him.</p></li>
<li><p>Sonic defends Tails when he gets bullied again. He doesn't know how to feel at first, and Tails is worried that Sonic might get bullied too.</p></li>
<li><p>At first Tails is somewhat dependent on Sonic, trailing him and trying to keep up. But over time, he begins feeling more confident with himself and his work. He grows and feels less afraid of being himself, and learns to embrace his twin tails.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3>Other assorted thoughts</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Over time, he teaches Sonic how to fix his plane in case he's
	not around for whatever reason. Sonic gets a bit frustrated because
	it tends to take a while to fix such things.</p>
	<li><p>In third person limited stories I refer to him as Miles since
	I think that&rsquo;s how he&rsquo;d see himself in his mind. The
	nickname wasn&rsquo;t made by him, but by those who made fun of him,
	and while it has taken new meaning after encouragement from his
	friends, it is still a bit of a sore spot.</p>
	<li><p>I think he'd have double joints at the end of his spine, which enables
	him to spin his twin-tails the way he does. He can&rsquo;t fly for
	too long but can sustain high ground speed longer.</p>
	<li><p>I think hyper forms each have an ability unique to the user,
	and Tails&rsquo; is summoning Flickies. I like to imagine they&rsquo;re
	from Cocoa Island.</p>
	<li><p>He likes sweetened coffee! He drinks too much when he wants
	to stay up and finish something.</p>
	<p></p>
