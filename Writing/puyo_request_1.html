                        <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;">I started doing writing requests for this series on Archive of our Own. It's been fun. These are all very short vignettes, between 100-1,000 words usually.</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;">Requested by the guest Regretting Everything. I think this one turned out pretty melancholy, and captures the lonely feeling a lot.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Time continues to pass. Weeks, months, years, Ex can no longer tell. His senses have been dulled after being here for so long. It was almost like feeling itself had become a distant memory.</p>

<p>Memories... Those too had faded with time. His life before this loneliness had become a blur. Still, there were bits and pieces that managed to stick out from time to time.</p>

<p>He hadn't always been alone. Once, a long time ago, Ex had been in love.</p>

<p>They had met somewhere dark, but lively. Her full name escaped him now, but she called herself "Mimi". She was ferocious and wild, a contrast to his gentle personality. They attracted each other like magnets. He remembered how it felt slow dancing with her, their hands wandering as they grew closer. Unconsciously, in the present, his hands wander over himself.</p>

<p>He sighs as he recalls their first kiss. How it had sent shockwaves down his body. Those waves come again as he tries to picture the moment, recalling how heated it was. Right now, it made him feel antsy. His hands lower, palming the bulge in his pants. He shudders at the contact.</p>

<p>Yes, it was coming back to him, how close they had gotten. The ways they would mark each other as their own. He recalled how proud she was of showing off the ones he left on her, which embarrassed him... now though, he wished he could see them again. All he had now was himself, and as his reminising continued, so too did the machinations on his body.</p>

<p>He pulled his dick out of his pants, feeling how warm he had gotten, and it reminded him of the warmth of her body. He couldn't remember every detail, but he knew she was gorgeous from head to toe. She had liked to tease him, edging him along, building up his anticipation. So in the present, he rubbed himself slowly to the memory. He pulled at the foreskin a bit, and pressed his thumb on the head, squeezing out some precum.</p>

<p>Memories of their intimacy flood Ex's mind. His eyes shut while he remembers her touch, her teasing, her body, her voice. How it felt to be so close to her, be within her. He became more desperate as more pictures came back to him and more jolts of pleasure struck his body. He wondered how she would see him now, getting himself this far off, clinging to times long past.</p>

<p>He imagined her calling out his name. He called back to her, and came. The release of tension felt wonderful; it had been a while since he had masturbated like this. It felt good to indulge like this.</p>

<p>Alas, as he fell from his high, the memories fade back into obscurity. He reaches out his messy hand, trying to grab them again. But he was too tired now. The thoughts had blurred again. He neatened himself up and laid down on the floor. Staring into the endless space.</p>
