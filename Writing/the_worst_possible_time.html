                    <p>The rock was sinking fast. The Blarrgs were coming in close. The situation looked grim for Mario and Bowser.</p>
<p>"There must be someway we can get out of this..." Mario moaned.</p>
<p>Bowser turned to look at him. "Yeah, about that..." he said with a look of fake innocence. "You're on your own..."</p>
<p>Mario stared at him with confusion. "Wha? What does that-a mean?"</p>
<p>"It means I'm leaving."</p>
<p>"You're just going to go?!" Mario yelled with his arms up in the air.</p>
<p>Bowser put on a silly smile and said "Yup!"</p>
<p>Now Mario was in utter disbelief. "I... wh.. y-you can't leave! You're still here stranded on this rock!"</p>
<p>"No I'm not." Then a whirring sound was heard in the air. The two looked up to see an airship flying above. It swooped in near the rock. On it was Junior and some koopa troopas.</p>
<p>"Hi Dad. I'm here to help you cheat death!" He dropped a ladder. Bowser waved to Mario and climbed the ladder. The ship started flying away.</p>
<p>Mario looked at it leaving him. "Hey! Can't you at least take me with you!?"</p>
<p>"Soorrry! Can't hear you! Too high up!" Bowser shouted. Soon the ship was out of sight.</p>
<p>Mario just stood there on the nearly submerged rock. He looked around, grunted, and muttered, "Classic."</p>
