                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Surprise. Another chapter, from Sig's perspective again. Written feverishly at 10pm, I simply felt like exploring the anguish of someone with twisted and confused emotions... I suppose this whole story is a little out of character for Sig, who I usually see as being very sympathetic and empathy about others feelings, but here he has a lot of trouble relating or understanding others at all. He's pretty sheltered in this modern au.</p>

                    <p>Sig awoke the next morning feeling warm. The sun had already risen, its light pouring through the window. He looked down and remembered where he was. Lemres was still asleep. His face seemed calm, but there was a hint of sadness in it. Sig realized he was still inside him. That might not have been very comfortable. He slowly removed himself so as not to wake the other man. Then he moved up and untied the tie from his wrists. Now, Lemres looked a little more peaceful, at least.</p>

<p>Sig got up and left the room. The living room was a bit disheveled from their scrap yesterday. It would be a shame to leave it like this. He began picking up the books and resetting the table they were on. After unbunching the small carpet as well, he sat on the couch, undure of what else to do. He didn't want to go home. It wouldn't be nice to leave Lemres alone now, right?</p>

<p>He thought back to last night. It had felt good, being so close to another person like that. He shivered, remembering the peak of the pleasure and being inside. But there was something off, too. He thought back again to Lemres. He felt like he had to tie him up so he wouldn't run. It had seemed reasonable with the heightened emotions of the time, but now the idea was weird. He shouldn't have needed to. After all, he was trying to help Lemres feel good, and that only seemed to stress him out more. Then, he thought back to his face. The bit of sadness in his closed eyes. Had he done the right thing? Did this actually help? He seemed so sure before. Now he was confused...</p>

<p>"Good morning, Sig." He heard behind him. He quickly turned around to see Lemres standing iloutside his bedroom. He smiled a little, seeing him again; it got him out of his thoughts. He replied in kind.</p>

<p>"We need to talk about last night." Of course, he would want to talk about it. Sig didn't feel ready, though. But Lemres looked firmly at him. He couldn't meet his gaze. "I know," he replies, "I was too foward." That was the best way he could describe it so far.</p>

<p>"That's... one way to put it," Lemres sighed, then continued. "You were very forceful with me yesterday. It wasn't right to do that. You have to realize."</p>

<p>He didn't seem to be very angry. But still, the way he spoke, it twisted Sig's stomach into knots. This kind of confrontation was new to him, but he tried to stay calm. "I only wanted to help you feel better." And he meant it. It was the best he could do, to be honest with him.</p>

<p>"I know. It's just. There were better ways to do that than... that. And you did come into my home uninvited. And then told me you were in love with me."</p>

<p>"I am. I don't feel like this about anyone else."</p>

<p>"This love of yours doesn't seem healthy. It's very... obsessed."</p>

<p>"Obsessed?" The word stood out to him, as it had been stressed. "Am I? I don't really... know." All these feelings were new to him. He realized he didn't know anything about how <em>regular</em> people fell in love or how they acted. He never looked into it. He had gone along with his feelings, let them take him to all these places, never questioned it, and did what felt the best. Had he always been like this?</p>

<p>The long silence was broken by Lemres. "I don't think you meant to hurt me, but you did. I need you to understand that. And I need you to understand that I.. I don't feel the same. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>A wave of something washes over Sig at those last few words. He's not sure what it is at all. It feels like panic, and he realizes he's trying not to *cry*. Suddenly, he can't be here anymore. It's too much for him. He needed to get out fast. At least he was used to leaving uncomfortable situations.</p>

<p>"Ok," he says, weaker than he meant, but he doesn't care. Once again, he can't meet the other man's gaze, so he stares at the ground. "Goodbye," he muttered as he quickly shuffled down the stairs and out of the building.</p>

<p>The walk home is a blur. He barely noticed anything around him as he walked briskly back to his place. Once he finally made it to his home, he let out a shaky breath and finally let himself cry.</p>

<p>Of <em>course</em>, he wouldn't feel the same, especially not after what he did to him. Why was he even surprised? Sig knew he didn't understand people. He didn't understand love between them. It seemed he didn't understand his own humanity either. His own confusing, terrible, <em>obsessed </em>feelings. He curled into himself, wishing he could become a chrysalis, transform into something better, and fly away from his pain.</p>

<p>He didn't go back to the bakery after that. He was too afraid of what he might do, seeing Lemres again. Would his obsession return? Would it have morphed into something else, something ugly? He didn't want to know. He didn't want to hurt him again. So he endured the pain he felt passing by that building where he once shared sweet memories and tried to leave them behind.</p>

                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> That's the end, for real this time. This story... is strange. Firstly, it's sinking my own ship. Which. Who does that. Second, it's kind of disconnected from the series, I think. But I connect with these characters, so I chose to make this piece with them despite how it came out. It's not very realistic, but it was a comfort to write. I don't know if anyone else will ever get anything out of it, but thanks for reading anyhow.</p>
