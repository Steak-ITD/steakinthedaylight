                    <p>Sonic lifted his mouth from Tails' softening cock. He began to swallow, but something was off about it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmm, what's the matter?&rdquo; Tails said, still recovering from his high.</p>
<p>Sonic swished the liquid around his mouth. &ldquo;Mint,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your cum. it tastes like mint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swallowing the rest, he leaned in to kiss his partner, who tiredly but quickly accepted him. He moves his tongue swiftly against Tails' mouth. When Sonic pulls back, he pushes against the roof of his mouth. His eyes lit up at the flavor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, it does taste just like mint! Fascinating...&rdquo; he looked down at his partner's erection. &ldquo;Let me blow you next, I want to see if yours tastes different too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonic chuckled at his enthusiasm. &rdquo;Why, for 'science'?&ldquo; he said, spreading his legs.</p>
<p>&rdquo;Of course,&ldquo; Tails replied before bending between them. Sonic wasn't sure if he was kidding or not. it was hard to tell with him sometimes.</p>
