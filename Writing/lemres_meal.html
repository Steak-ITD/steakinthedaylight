                      <h3>PART 1 OF 2</h3>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Spontaeneously came up with the idea of Lemres and his family being a vampire. Another vice to (fail to) overcome.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Lemres liked hanging out with Klug. It was fun reading about magic and legends together. Though Lemres was sometimes a bit overwhelmed by Klug's enthusiasm about him. He didn't think of himself as particularly spectacular, despite what others said. Oh well. No need to dwell on it.</p>
<p>The two young boys were having a study session that went long, into the night. Klug was having trouble getting the material down, and he wasn't about to give up, despite his constant yawning, or his heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>Strangely, Lemres didn't seem to be tired at all.</p>
<p>"Hey, it's pretty late already. Maybe we should call it quits for now?" He said anyway.</p>
<p>"Nooo, I gotta... Gotta figure this out..." Klug slurred, and yawned again.</p>
<p>"Can you even read anymore? You look like you might collapse!"</p>
<p>Lemres giggled as Klug mumbled something incomprehensible. Knowing his friend, he wouldn't be awake much longer. So he went over to Klug and lifted him off the chair, planning to carry him to his room. Sure enough, the smaller boy fell asleep in his arms.</p>
<p>Lemres smiled to himself when he heard a small snore. Klug was so precious when he slept. So precious, and so vulnerable.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>Why did that cross his mind?</p>
<p>Lemres looked at the sleeping boy in his arms again. Yeah, he was really cute, that's all... The moonlight from the windows accentuated his soft skin, almost as if it were made of moonlight itself. Come to think of it, now that they were so close, he realized how nice Klug smelled. Old books and pen ink, and something deeper, sweeter...</p>
<p>...There it was again! This weird feeling, like he was sizing up his friend. Why? It's not like he was...</p>
<p><em>growwwl</em></p>
<p>... Oh.</p>
<p>Lemres didn't have any sugar today. He was having so much fun, he didn't eat anything, and now he couldn't keep his <em>urges</em> down.</p>
<p>How could he be so foolish? This was routine, he did this every single day, how could he forget? Such an idiot! He could almost cry.</p>
<p>But it was ok. He had a perfectly good meal in his hands now.</p>
<p><em>No! Don't think like that! He's your friend! You can't... you can't be like</em> them.</p>
<p><em>growwwwl</em></p>
<p>Lemres' hands became shaky, and his breaths quick. His mind and body were at odds. He didn't want this. All these years he had been able to resist feeding. He couldn't let that go to waste because of one night. He could still salvage his innocence. The bedroom wasn't far now. He would bring Klug there, tuck him into bed, and go right home and bite down real hard on a lollipop, and everything would be ok.</p>
<p>He was almost there.</p>
<p>Almost there, to that sweet relief.</p>
<p>He looked down again.</p>
<p>He sighed.</p>
<p>His teeth glistened with drool. He let it drip for a moment, and a hiss escaped his throat. Finally, <em>finally</em>, he bit. Immediately iron filled his mouth, soaked his tongue. So sweet, so savory, like buttery strawberry pancakes, but so much thicker. He shook with each gulp, disbelief that <em>this is what he had been missing.</em> Sugar simply couldn't compare.</p>
<p><em>So delicious... Thank you so much...</em></p>
<p>He lifted his head with much hesitation, once he felt full enough. But he had to lick his lips too, and the streak of red leaking from his friend's neck. He heard a moan below him, and strangely he didn't panic, too full of ecstasy to care much.</p>
<p>"Mm... Lemres?" Klug looked blearily at him.</p>
<p>"Shh. It's ok. Go to sleep," Lemres replied quietly. He carefully moved his hands to close the sleepy boy's eyes again, and he complied quickly, still so tired.</p>
<p>Moving a bit faster now, they finally reached the bedroom, and the bed. Lemres lay Klug carefully, and pulled the sheets over him. He flicked the remaining red off his neck, and looked away.</p>
<p>Sucking on his finger, Lemres realized he now felt quite sleepy. As tempting as it was to just stay there, he had to get home. He opened a window to let some air in, summoned his broom, and lept out.</p>
<p>He tried not to think about anything. But thoughts of red filled his mind.</p>

                    <p>When Klug woke up, the first thing he noticed was that his neck was sore. Then he realized he was in bed, and not at his desk.</p>
<p>Right, he was studying with Lemres last night , and then... Hmm.</p>
<p>His memory was hazy, but he must have been carries to bed. There was something else though. He thought he saw something... glistening, in moonlight. Something sharp, and red, and white.</p>
<p>He left later to go see his friend, who seemed happy, if a bit jumpy. "Morning sleepyhead! Did you sleep well?"</p>
<p>"I think so, but my neck is a bit sore. I guess I slept on it wrong." Klug said while rubbing his neck. "Oh, thanks for carrying me to bed."</p>
<p>"No problem. But we should really get to sleep sooner next time, ok?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. By the way, last night, I think I saw something weird."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?"</p>
<p>"There was something shining on you, I think. It was pointy and red."</p>
<p>Lemres' smile faltered, just for a second. Klug almost didn't notice.</p>
<p>"That is weird. Maybe it was a dream though. You were out like a light, you know."</p>
<p>"Oh... I guess so. It just felt so vivid..."</p>
<p>"Hey, since you're here, do you want to come in? I have lollipops!"</p>
<p>"... Sure!" Klug nodded enthusiastically, and followed Lemres inside. He didn't think much of his dream after that.</p>
