                    <ol type="1">
                    <li><b>Friends to lovers!</b> In my opinion, you can't really get into a relationship with someone if you can't be friends with them first. This trope shows a progression with the characters learning about each other and their lives, helping each other get better. To me it feels the most natural.<br> <b>Opposites attract, or otherwise unlikely seeming pairings.</b><br> Contrasts are always interesting to me. I like my ships to have at least some contrasting elements. Two or more opposite personalities clashing and eventually coming closer together is a challenge to write but when it comes together it's very satisfying. I want them to find the things they CAN relate to with each other. See how they solve their conflicts. How they both affect and learn from each other and how they change with their experiences.<b>Two oddballs who love each other a whole bunch, while the rest of the world burns around them!</b> But also sometimes I like when both or more characters have a "perfect" bond already and just love the heck out of each other so much. But the conflict is outside their relationship: the people around them don't want them to be together for whatever reason, or something in the world is preventing them from being together, like constant danger. This one ends up being more comedic, so it's really fun.<br></li>
                    <li>Couples that constantly bicker, not in a cute, flirtatious or close friendship way, but bitterly and naggy-like. (looking at you rom coms.) "Will they won't they" is very VERY annoying to me. It's also in rom coms AND sitcoms. Beligerent sexual tension isn't as bad, but still kind of sucky to get through, and I can't get into it very much, or similar stuff like Tsundere.</li>
                    <li>Empathy between the couples. How they can find it, and relatability in their situations, even if they're different.</li>
                    <li>Couple of things: I like size differences, whether it be a few feet or a few kilometers. Also, I like this kind of pair that's like... a doofy funny looking guy and a saucy hot lady (like Crash and Tawna Bandicoot)</li>
                    <li>Multiship. I like to explore different combinations and possibilities. Also, shipping wars are stupid and a waste of time.</li>
                    <li>It depends entirely on the pairing. Whether it's popular or not plays no factor into whether or not I'm interested in.</li>
                    <li>Again, it depends on the pairing. I haven't found too many polyamorous pairings I could get into, but I'm not closed off to them at all. Actually, one of my favorites is EntourageShipping - Diamond, Pearl & Platinum Berlitz. Also, sometimes I could envision open relationships for couples.</li>
                    <li>I think this is in reference to topping and bottoming. I usually have it reversible, but with one or all characters having a preference one way or another.</li>
                    <li>Once again, it depends on the <i>media.</i> This isn't something i like to force out of obligation. Ships will interest me or they won't you know?</li>
                    <li>It's relatively important to me, because i think it can be indicative of the bond between the characters. I like imagining stuff like, who would be on top or bottom more frequently, what things they're each into and how they talk about it, how they flirt with each other, and so on.</li>
                    <li>I don't think I'd call them ships without the romance. Since they're usually marked with an ampersand rather than a slash. But i do also like exploring platonic relationships.</li>
                    <li><b>Sonic/Tails(StH).</b> Obviously this fits into friends to lovers. Also, I feel like these two were made to contrast each other, from their personalities down to their colors being opposite. Even still they complement each other really well, providing strengths to each others weakness. Of course Tails learns from Sonic to be more outgoing and confident in himself, but I also like to think Sonic learns from Tails to not think so fast, look at what else is around him. I think he also admires Tails' resilience and intelligence. They help each other become better versions of themselves, and they know each other well enough to know what each of them are thinking. <a href="https://aethy.com/@steakinthedaylight/109692100801915738">I describe it in more detail here.</a> <br><b>Boyfriend/Girlfriend(FNF).</b> These two are both horny little shits and proud of it. They're also just generally really weird. I find it really endearing that two oddballs were able to find each other and just be so incredibly happy in their own company, while everyone else is out to get them. I hope we see more about their relationship as the game develops further.<br><b> Milla Basset/Neera Li(FP).</b> This might seem a bit weird, but this pair emerged for me after finishing the sequel. These two have some unique interactions in the game. Milla is childish of course, but she also has a certain amount of maturity to her words. She's sensitive to how other people are feeling, picking up on them better than anyone else in the game. Even if the way she talks is immature, she clearly takes things seriously. I think this shows in her reactions with Neera, who is much more stern and cold. She's not afraid to say how she feels, and she tells Milla when she's acting foolish. But it seems like Milla is the one who can really look through Neera's actions and words and tell what she's trying to express, see that she has severe trust issues, and can genuinely tell her she understands and that she can trust her. Milla also has a lot of respect for her, and she does feel sorry when Neera criticizes her. This relationship seems very opposite but when you look at it, I think these two are more similar than it looks.</li>
                    <li>When I still participated in fandom, I got into Ludwig/Rosalina(SMB) because it was popular amongst the current koopaling fan club. I used to be more into Tails/Cream(StH). I still like this one, just not as much nowadays. The last few are Steven/Wallace(Pokemon), Brendan/May(Pokemon), and Blue/Red(Pokemon).</li>
                    <li>I see it as more of a legal thing. You do get benefits like tax, social security and IRA stuff (in the US). I think the symbolism of a neverending bond is very lovely, and I do like the scenery and clothing associated with marriage, but the act itself, the legal binding isn't too neccessary to me.</li>
                    <li>I don't get invested in them too often. Though I have created one for at least one of my favorite pairings. My thing with them is, a lot tend to just look like fusions of the characters whom raise them. Also, it kind of takes attention away from the pairing itself.</li>

                    <h4>Special Cases:</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Sonic/Amy:</b> This depends a lot on which canon is in use. In general I like her more in Classic universe than Modern. Honestly, she has the biggest changes between them. Classic Amy clearly has a crush on Sonic and wants to be around him, but she also wants him to respect her for her skills. Modern Amy is in love with him, which comes off as obsession, and she's always trying to find ways to force Sonic to date/marry her. The first is a lot more endearing to me. This trait is exacerbated a lot in Sonic X. It's toned down in Sonic Boom, so it seems a lot more, uh, casual there? Like it would happen a bit more naturally, over time, if Amy would ever admit it. I haven't read much of the Shogakuken manga, but from what it seems I think they're a cute couple there. Haven't read much of the other comics.</li>
                    <li><b>Sonic/Shadow:</b> I have many feelings about Shadow. To make a long story overly short: I like his character before his own game. And so that's the version of him I like with Sonic. They were, I guess, made to be different, but I think they're bonded by the fact that they are both free spirits in a way, and fiercely loyal. It has appeal. But in his post "Shadow the Hedgehog character? no. And particularly not with how Sonic is like in some 2010 games, or in Sonic Boom.</li>
                    <li><b>Tails/Knuckles:</b> Classic only. I feel like their classic characters might compliment each other in a different and distinct way. But eh, the Modern ones feel better as just friends/bros. This could be attributed to a certain scene in Sonic Riders that puts me off them having a deeper relationship (where Knuckles implies gadgets is all Tails is good at).</li>
                    <li><b>Amy/[Bark]:</b> I dunno why he's not on this chart? But yeah, I really enjoyed their interactions in the 30th anniversary comic and I wanna see them together more!</li>
                    <li><b>Silver/[Eggman Negative]:</b> I think this has potential to be a very twisted, harsh dynamic, moreso than the counterpart Sonic/Eggman (it also has that potential but I find it more funny). Usually I would think of it as unhealthy and/or non consensual, but I do wonder what it would be like if it was... neither of those. Intersting thought challenge.</li>
