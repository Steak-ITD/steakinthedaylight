                    <p>"Hi, Sonic." </p>

                    <p>Talking to him shouldn't feel like this. So foreign, far away. He's her friend. No, he was more than that now.  And yet, just looking at him put a pit in her stomach. It made her quills point up. But there's no danger here. There's no danger here. </p>
                    
                    <p>"Hey there, Amy. How've you been?" He has on his usual casual smile. Something familiar. </p>
                    
                    <p>"I'm ok," she says, unsure how true it is. She hasn't been getting much sleep lately. And when she does, she wakes up with a headache. And sometimes short of breath. And sometimes... a wet spot in her underwear. She isn't sure why. She can't remember her dreams. Her memories of the last week are foggy, waving like water. But the feeling of confusion is still there, lingering like the dew on a petal.  But she doesn't say any of this. She just said she's ok. She didn't want Sonic to worry, especially not now, when good things were happening in their relationship.  </p>
                    
                    <p>"Hey, listen..." his smile raises just a bit. "About the other day. I want you to know something."  The other day. The day that they did... what lovers do, he had said. The day that he said he loved her too. The day... that made her feel... </p>
                    
                    <p>"I, uhm. I meant what I said. About, you know, my feelings."  His hands reached out and held hers. She was stiff at the touch. She hoped he didn't notice.</p>
                    
                    <p>"And I know you feel the same way. And we had fun, didn't we?" </p>
                    
                    <p>*didn't we? did I? I'm not sure.* </p>
                    
                    <p>"Yeah," she said, more quietly than she would have liked.  "Yeah. I think we should go out again sometime. It's nice being together. Just the two of us." He started to rub her wrists very softly.  </p>
                    
                    <p>*it was nice, wasn't it? I don't know anymore* </p>
                    
                    <p>"What do you think?" Awaiting her reply. </p>
                    
                    <p>"I'd love to," she said before really realizing it. </p>
                    
                    <p>"Cool. And hey, don't feel too nervous, ok? Trust me." </p>
                    
                    <p>*trust him.* </p>
                    
                    <p>He waved and raced away as fast as ever. She stood there, trying to finish her thoughts.  </p>
                    
                    <p>*i should, i should trust him* </p>
                    
                    <p>*just like I did before when we...* </p>
                    
                    <p>*w-we...* </p>
                    
                    <p>She heaved over where she stood. There was that sick feeling again. And her head was pounding, too. She touched her wrists where Sonic had been rubbing them. All at once, her tears came out, and she shivered.  She should have said something, should have told him, but he seemed so happy with her, how could she ruin that?</p>
                    
                    <p>She couldn't. She had to be stronger than this.  This is what love was like, right? She just had to toughen up, and then maybe these feelings and fears would go away. She had to do this, for her and Sonic, she had to...</p>
