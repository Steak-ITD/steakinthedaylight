                    <h3>PART 2 OF 2</h3>
                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Rape and Murder!</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> After almost 2 years on and off, I finished the story! I don't know if it's the most fucked up thing I've written but it's up there. It's also probably the longest. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>By this point in time, it had been weeks since anyone had seen Jabez or Hashim. It became apparent to the other monsters in the neighborhood that they were that obsessed with each other.</p>
<p>For Peal the dark Meowth, it had been much longer since he'd seen Jabez. The last time they talked had... not ended on good terms. Their breakup was very rough, and afterward, the two wordlessly avoided each other. Peal didn't keep up on Jabez's life, but he could at least figure out he had moved on with his new partner, and wouldn't want anything to do with him anymore.</p>
<p>So when that new partner, Hashim, came to find him, saying Jabez had wanted to see him, it was a surprise.</p>
<p>The Slowking seemed very odd to him. He apparently knew exactly where he lived, for one thing. Kind of a personal thing for Jabez to tell him. When he opened the door to him, his face contained no emotion, none that Peal could sense. His tone was very matter-of-fact, sounding like a businessman giving out an order.</p>
<p>"You are Peal. The Meowth," he spoke out dully. He was staring straight into his eyes.</p>
<p>"Um, yes, that's me," he had replied, trying not to look back, but feeling somewhat intimidated by this larger monster. "Aren't you...?"</p>
<p>"Jabez wants to see you. Come with me." And he simply turned around and started walking.</p>
<p>Peal was confused and put off by this aloofness, but he decided to follow regardless. He wasn't sure what to expect. It's not like Peal hated Jabez, and he *had* wanted things to work out between them. Maybe he wanted to reconcile, become friends at least?</p>
<p>It was a pretty long walk to the shore, of all places. There was no conversation between the two monsters. It made Peal feel awkward, and a bit anxious. Was this Slowking always like this? Or was it something Peal did?</p>
<p>Once they got on the boat Hashim set up, Peal finally decided to break the silence. "So.. how has Jabez been?"</p>
<p>"He is ok," Hashim said, once again in that dull tone. Surprisingly, he actually continued after. "In fact, he is... just... wonderful."</p>
<p>There was a small hint of what seemed like... awe, in his voice that time. Again Peal felt a little awkward hearing that from his ex's new partner. But hey, it looked like they were happy together.</p>
<p>They finally reached the island with the temple. Now Peal looked a bit in awe. This was a very old place, old enough that no one knew its purpose. The last time he saw it, it look as dusty and dull as an old temple ought to be. Now, it looked as though it were built only a few days ago. Had they decided to live here, or something?</p>
<p>Once they landed and got off the board, Peal got a better look. He went a bit ahead of Hashim, curious to see what the inside looked like. As he approached, he smelled something a bit weird... a bit like... copper?</p>
<p>He arrived in the main room. It was shiny and bright, and there was the sound of running water. But the copper smell was even stronger. He spotted a fountain up ahead, the source of the running water... but something was off. The water looked dirty, as did the statue on top. He kept walking to get a closer look. The closer he got, the more worried he became.</p>
<p>The water wasn't just dirty, it was sickly shades of red and yellow. There were... more statues around it? And the one on top was moving!</p>
<p>It *smiled* at him, saying, "Wow, Peal. It's good to see you."</p>
<p>"Ja-" Before he could get out a word, he felt a breaking palm on his back. He fell to the ground with a slam, vision becoming blurry. He turned around on the ground. He saw Hashim behind him, holding his palm up. Again, before he could react, Hashim hit Peal again, with a fighting move he could tell. This time he couldn't move again afterward. His head was pounding.</p>
<p>Peal felt himself being dragged, helpless to stop it. As they got even closer to the fountain, in his blurry vision, he realized those other "statues" looked familiar. Two Indeedee lay still on the side. A Dedenne floated along the stream, and a Sentret was face down in the pool. Peal felt tears begin to fall from his eyes. This is what the two of them had been doing all this time? They were both insane...</p>
<p>"W-pl-" he still couldn't talk, and could barely move. Hashim had finally stopped dragging him, and they were right in front of the base. Lifting Peal's head up, he slammed him again into the filthy water. Peal tried desperately to hold his breath, but the force of being pushed in made it difficult.</p>
<p>Then he felt something else on his back, near his butt. he almost didn't realize it in trying not to drown, but that crazy Slowking was doing something to him down there! He didn't want to know what it was that was causing him this much pain. He just needed to try staying alive right now...</p>
<p>But then the *pounding* began, and his body kept moving back and forth, his nose filling with the filthy water, his back and behind stinging him. The aches and pains he already had grew. He felt utterly helpless as his lungs and his behind were simultaneously filled, feeling like he was being torn apart. He eventually couldn't keep up; he lost consciousness, the treatment never letting up, and his last tired thought was knowing he wouldn't wake up again.</p>

<p>Once Hashim finally felt it was enough, he pulled his fist out of the cat's hole. He had left behind a crooked and bloody mess. He looked up at his love and smiled. "Now it's done," he simpers.</p>
<p>Jabez looked down at the pool of bodies, all those that causes him so much pain in his old life. Now he could watch them suffer for their crimes, and feel his pain wash away in this beautiful gift for him. He hears Hashim sing to him, songs of praise and love and worship.</p>
<p>This was living, he thought to himself. This was what it felt like to have his dream come true.</p>
