                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Another stream-of-conciousness about the way the crimson demon was split apart so many years ago. It's short but I think it's worth having somewhere on my site.</p>
                    <hr>
<p>One thing that stood out to me about the crimson spirit's original power was the description of it being hidden within their soul, and the power being dangerous and malevolent. I think that malevolent energy remained when they were split apart. I also think the demon's personality itself was split apart. The dramatic and angry part of the full soul was taken away from the introverted calm part. But I also think the book took part of the power as well. It could either be that the book took the part of the power that kept it under control, or the power is hard to keep under control (without outside interference) without the full personality. I also don't think a recombination would erase Sig, but rather add to him. Give him extra personality in a way. But he would still be himself.</p>
                    <p>For my <a href="/Images/Edits/crimson.html">oc version</a>, i imagined them as being a combination of the soul's and Sig's traits. I thought perhaps they had control of their power and their emotions, and if they started to feel too strongly, like extreme anger, the power would act up amd they would have to stabilize themself. I think it's harder for Sig to do this by himself because he only has half that willpower, the other half being the crimson soul.</p>
