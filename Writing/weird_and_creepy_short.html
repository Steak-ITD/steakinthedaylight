                    <hr>
                    <p>Another "missing" poster appeared along the walls of the town. Deirdre recognized this man as well, if only barely. Someone of a rich or noble standing, who had been sending her the usual gifts. Another suitor vying for her affections.</p>

<p>Nothing she wasn't used to by now. There had been many like him, and their were likely to be more in the future. She would simply decline their advances politely. Though it was somewhat frustrating and rude how they never took the hint that she wasn't interested. After all, she had chosen her partner already.</p>

<p>Reaching her home, she was greeted immediately by the one she shared it with.  "Good afternoon, my love," Sigurd said, pulling Deirdre into a strong hug. She smiles and leans into him.</p>

<p>"Hello, dear... Listen..." she pulled away from him slightly, looking him in the eyes. "I saw another poster on my way home. Another missing person."</p>

<p>"Hmm. Yes, I've heard of it. A string of nobles disappearing mysteriously."</p>

<p>Deirdre sighs. "Sigurd... Perhaps... you should tone down this 'hobby' of yours?"</p>

<p>Sigurd's eyes widen, before he looks away from her quickly. "I- how did you-"</p>

<p>"I saw the pattern. Rich men who had tried to court me, and the way you get about them when you find out."</p>

<p>She reached a hand to his face, directing him towards her. His mouth was agape as he attempted to say something, but he was at a loss for words.</p>

<p>"I know. You just want to keep me safe. But it's only a matter of time before someone else sees. I don't want you to get in trouble. So, please. Will you be a little more calm?"</p>

<p>"... Alright. For you, I will be more careful."   His hug became tight again, and she cherished his warmth, feeling just as safe as he'd like.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>The sun had set late that day. Deirdre walked into the bedroom, changed into her nightgown. Sigurd was there already, lazing about in their bed. She went and joined him, and they snuggled up to each other under the sheets.</p>

<p>"I love you so much, Deirdre," he whispered into her ear.</p>

<p>"I love you too, Sigurd," she replied.</p>

<p>"You are so smart, so kind," he continued, his hand tracing lines down her back. "I can't help but want you all to myself." Deirdre hummed in acknowledgement. A blush began to form on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"When I see those other men try to take you from me..." Sigurd goes on, his voice becoming darker. His hand moves lower on her back, and the other shifts somewhere on the bed. "... I know it's uncouth, but I feel a deep rage. A hatred that boils my blood."</p>

<p>The hand that was on her back now rested  just above her posterior, and she leaned into it unconsciously. Her eyes were fixated on his other hand, moving to grab something. As he found what he was looking for, she gasped softly when she saw the item.</p>

<p>A dagger, still stained in red. His grip on it was tight as he slowly brought it to her face. Even the smell was strong, as if it had been freshly used.</p>

<p>"To think they could ever deserve you... that their pitiful trinkets could ever be enough." Sigurd growled through his teeth.</p>

<p>Deirdre stared at the dagger. A direct confirmation of her suspicion. She thought she should be scared, or horrified, or more shocked then she was.</p>

<p>Yet, the blush on her face grew. The idea that someone was so devoted to a girl like her... So protective...</p>

<p>She moaned as the hand touching her reached lower again, fingers caressing her lips, coaxing them open. She closed her eyes and sniffed, letting the iron scent fill her head.</p>

<p>"I wanted them to pay. To suffer. They would never learn another way." Sigurd finished. The dagger was pointed directly at Deirdre. But she felt no fear. Despite herself, she leaned in closer and opened her mouth, letting it rest on her tongue. She sucked on the blade, relishing the taste, as well as the fingers pushing around inside of her.</p>

<p>It was wonderful, feeling so adored. What fools those other men were. As if they could ever match Sigurd's love for her. She giggled at the notion, imagining their reactions seeing the extent of his devotion.</p>

<p>She finished licking the blood just as she reached her climax, caressed by her partner as she shook in pleasure. By the time she calmed down, she was wrapped in the warmth of the sheets and her lover's arms.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Deirdre whispered, and Sigurd kissed her forehead. They snuggled further into each other and soon fell asleep, dreams full of love, and dripping red.</p>
