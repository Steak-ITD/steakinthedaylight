                    <h2>Part 1: The Relationship</h2>
                    <p>- The two of them spend more time together as the years go by, becoming closer friends.</p>
                    <p><br /> - Sonic kisses Cream on the cheek to make her feel better after getting hurt. He later questioned why he did this specifically but forgets it. Cream, meanwhile, has a kind of awakening; she likes Sonic's affection and wants more.</p>
                    <p><br /> - She lets him know this. Sonic kisses her cheek again out of kindness. After a little stare, Cream kisses his cheek back. He's a little shocked but accepts it. Again, he lets it slide, concluding it is just overly friendly stuff.</p>
                    <p><br /> - It's a while before the next time they kiss, it happens in a peaceful moment while they're hanging out together (Sonic babysits Cream at her mom's request but she insists they don't call it that anymore). After laughing at a joke together, they kiss, this time on the lips.</p>
                    <p><br /> - They don't question it in the moment, but later, Sonic becomes worried about his growing feelings, trying to justify it in various ways. Meanwhile, Cream is confused about her feelings, knowing that kind of kiss is more intimate, and that it makes her feel "warm", thinking about how close she was to Sonic.</p>
                    <p><br />- When they hang out, they begin to kiss more regularly. Sonic shows Cream how to use her tongue to make it more fun.</p>
                    <p><br /> - Cream is in the middle of puberty, and beginning to have a libido. That warmth starts to become more bothersome. She has never masturbated before and she doesn't think askimg her mom will yield satisfying answers. So she goes to Sonic for help. He is very hesitant at first, but seeing how frustrated she is, he relents and shows her how she can finger herself, eventually helping her along with his hand. He gets hard while doing this but brushes it off when Cream notices. Later, Sonic jerks off to the memory, still feeling guilty but justifying in his mind that his friend needed help and that's all he did, helped a friend. Cream also later fingers herself to the memory, feeling so grateful she knows what to do and thinking of Sonic's hard-on. Imagining what else they could do.</p>
                    <p><br /> - They begin to get more physical around each other, Cream initiating closer touches when they kiss. Rubbing her genitals on his while still clothed. Sonic shies away from this, wanting to make sure these sessions are all about Cream and her pleasure. He suggests new things to try like licking her pussy as a way to do that. It makes him feel less guilty, and it makes Cream feel good, which is the most important thing! But Cream notices what he does, and she wants Sonic to feel good too, so she becomes more insistent in her touches and rubbing, and over time, Sonic is less resistant. Her happiness is his happiness.</p>
                    <p><br /> - It eventually goes too far for him, when one night as they're rubbing together, he realizes Cream isn't wearing her underpants, leaving their genitalia to touch directly. It drives him crazy mentally, but he tries to retain control of himself. But Cream is being particularly bold, stroking his cock as well, kissing his ears, whispering that she's in love with him. Weakly he tries to stop her before he comes, but ends up doing so anyway; one of his strongest orgasms, all over her crotch.</p>
                    <p><br /> - After it's over, the realization hits him like a truck. He panics over what he did. Cream tries to ask if he's ok, but before she can react, he jumps out the nearest window and runs away.</p>
                    <p><br /> - Sonic is full of regret and anger over himself, how he's been so selfish, how he's ruined Cream's life... he seems inconsolable. But while he's curled up in a ball, he hears someone's voice behind him. Cream had followed his path, being able to keep up with him thanks to all the times they'd run together. Sonic starts crying when he tries to explain why what they've been doing isn't right, but Cream doesn't understand everything. She is convinced that Sonic wouldn't hurt her on purpose and she still loves him. Despite everything else he wants to say, he only responds that he loves her too. They kiss again and they end up having full sex right there, before rushing home and getting cleaned up.</p>
                    <p><br /> - They continue seeing each other, secretly having sex when alone together. Things seem to go smoothly for a few months. Everyone is happy...</p>
                    <p><br /> - Cream begins to feel weird. She feels sick in the morning, her temperature is high, and she starts bloating. Her mom begins to take notice, and one morning, she puts together that Cream is pregnant. She won't say who the father is, not wanting to ruin Sonic's reputation.</p>
                    <p><br /> - Once it becomes more visible to everyone else, Vanilla admits that Cream has gotten pregnant to her friends, including Sonic. He gives her an apologetic look, which she returns.</p>
                    <p><br /> - Vanilla wants to spend more time with Cream and make sure she's ok, so her and Sonic don't see each other much throughout the pregnancy. When Sonic comes to visit once, Vanilla implies that she figured out that he was the father, so he doesn't stay long.</p>
                    <p><br /> - Cream eventually gives birth to a rabbit-hedgehog hybrid (though not obvious at first glance) and names him Peanut. She has to give him up for adoption as she doesn't feel ready to raise him. Sonic doesn't get to see him.</p>
                    <p><br /> - Next time they are alone together, Sonic suggests it would be best if they didn't continue their skinship, and Cream agrees, but says she still loves him. Sonic can only say thank you. He's now afraid of his lack of self-control after what has happened. They remain friends, though Sonic distances himself a bit.</p>
