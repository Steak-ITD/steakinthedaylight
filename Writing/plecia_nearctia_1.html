                    <h3>PART 1 OF 4</h3>
                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> beginnings of stalking </p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> I can't just write a ship normally, I gotta make it creepy and/or weird. This time I wrote Lemres and Sig as full grown adults in a modern setting, and also Sig is yandere and kind of unstable. I'm kind of embarrassed about how it turned out, it's a bit longer than my usual stuff. I wrote it somewhat feverishly.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Sig never really cared much for other humans. He could get along with others with practiced motions and chatter. But beyond that, there simply wasn't much feeling or interest. It didn't usually bother him that much since he had more of a kinship with his insects. Like him, they knew exactly what they wanted and how to get it. It all came so naturally to them, and they didn't let anything get in their way.</p>
                    <p>And yet, as he would watch his bugs during springtime, a common mating season, he would feel a sort of longing for something more. The march flies around him, they share their bodies and minds with each other for several days to a lifetime, a rarity amongst arthropods. A part of him wondered what it felt like, to give yourself so much to another. But unlike his bugs, people were so... complicated. They made things like mating so needlessly complex. He could barely wrap his head around it.</p>
                    <p>So he had resigned himself to never finding this right person, so to speak. And for a while, he was content.</p>
                    <p>Until one afternoon. A warm spring day, blue sky clear of all clouds. Sig walked down the sidewalks of his hometown, feeling peckish. He wasn't sure what he wanted to eat. While he passed by each shop, he stopped at something new. An unfamiliar window, full of many baked goods. This small building hadn't been occupied for a while. It piqued his curiosity. He opened the clear door, and after hearing the chime of a bell, he was bombarded with a heavy, sweet scent. The room was much like the window; full of cakes and pies, even some candy.</p>
                    <p>Despite himself, he felt saliva grow in his mouth. He did enjoy a good sweet now and then, and so did his bugs.</p>
                    <p>"Hello there~" Sig's thoughts were interrupted by a cheerful voice from the back of the store. A young man stood behind the counter, a large smile across his face. He carried a pan of freshly baked cupcakes. "Welcome to my bakery!"</p>
                    <p>Sig stared at the man for a moment, taking in his details. His yellowish-grey hair covered one of his eyes, and the other appeared to be perpetually closed. His skin was soft and just the slightest bit tan. He almost seemed to glow, even amongst the light color of the walls... Sig realized he had been looking too long and finally walked up to the counter.</p>
                    <p>"Can I get you anything? I just finished decorating these cupcakes. Would you like to try one?" The man's voice was deep, yet kind and enthusiastic. Sig eyed the cupcakes curiously. They were dark brown, and chocolate, most likely, and they were decorated with green frosting and small circular candies. He took one carefully and bit into it. It was the perfect combination of moist and firm, and the frosting didn't overpower it. </p>
                    <p>"It's delicious," Sig said after swallowing. "How much?"</p>
                    <p>"The first one is on the house. I'm glad you like it!"</p>
                    <p>"Hmm, not a very good business strategy."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, that's alright. I'm just happy to make others happy." The whole time, this man seemed to be beaming. His joy was almost contagious. Sig couldn't help but stare again. The man was slight but with a bit of fat in his belly, likely from eating his own food.</p>
                    <p>"Would you like any more? I can get it packed for you right away."</p>
                    <p>Again snapped out of his thoughts, Sig nodded, wanting to take the whole batch. He paid the amount given on the register and watched as the cupcakes were neatly packed into boxes. His hands looked so delicate, yet they moved swiftly across everything. </p>
                    <p>"By the way, what's your name? My name is Lemres. It's a pleasure to meet you!"</p>
                    <p>"Sig. Nice to meet you, too."</p>
                    <p>After Sig left and returned home, he was careful with the bag, not wanting to ruin the nicely done design. He couldn't stop thinking about the baker. He looked just as sweet as his goods did. And his name. Lemres... it was strange, like his own, but it rolled off his tongue perfectly. He wanted to see him again. Soon. It was getting late, though. The stores were likely closing by now. But the building had multiple stories. Perhaps he lived up above? </p>
                    <p>Before he knew what he was doing, he was walking back down the same street. Not that he hadn't been walking at night before (some bugs were nocturnal after all). But this felt different. There was a slight sense of urgency somehow. He had to know.</p>
                    <p>He reached the building again. Sure enough, the bakery had closed by now. The lights were still on, however. Sig peeked through the window covered in cakes. Lemres was still inside, closing and cleaning up. Just like before, he worked with a delicate and precise touch. After he was done, he went through a doorway on the left, and soon, a light came on up above. So he did live on the second floor. His window curtains were open, though, from this angle, it was hard to see anything. Perhaps, if Sig sat in a nearby tree, he could get a better view. He had to see him more. He was so alluring, like a firefly in the forest.</p>
                    <p>Climbing up a tree in the nearby small park across from the building, he did indeed get a better look, but it was small. He did see movement but couldn't make out what was going on. He was a bit frustrated by this. If only he were a small beetle, then he could just fly over and rest on his window, allowing him to see everything... but as he is, a pair of binoculars would have to do.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> I focused a lot on describing his thought process, which came easily for this chapter and the next one, but was a bit harder for the third.</p>
