                    <h3>PART 4 OF 4</h3>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> This time we go into Lemres' pov. He's naturally a kind person and is having trouble processing this event. He wants to believe the best of people but still realizes he's been hurt, and tries to justify it in his mind. I hope it's... convincing? Writing this part was rather difficult...</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Lemres watched Sig nod off, too afraid to do anything else. Not that there was much he could do regardless. He was still tied up and still penetrated.</p>
<p>He was in disbelief. What had he done to deserve this? Did he anger Sig somehow? No, he said he was in love. But this kind of "love", it was twisted and unhealthy. He didn't want this.</p>
<p>But he didn't want to believe he was bad, either... they had been friends, and he was sure that was real, if skewed given these events. He didn't hate him despite what happened. Maybe he didn't know better, and he thought this was okay. He was... he was probably lonely. That's something he could understand.</p>
<p>It didn't make this any better, though.</p>
<p>Eventually, he did fall into a dark, dreamless sleep. He awoke the next morning feeling sore both above and below and remembering exactly why. At least he was free to move around, albeit painfully.</p>
<p>He went out to his living room, which was still as neat as he left it, if a bit neater. He gulped when he saw Sig sitting on the couch, staring through the wall. Well, if he was still here, then he supposed he could rip the bandage off now.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Sig," Lemres spoke a bit firmly.</p>
<p>Sig turned quickly to look at him, a small smile crossing his face. "Good morning," he murmured.</p>
<p>"We need to talk about last night."</p>
<p>"I know," Sig looked away, "I was too forward."</p>
<p>"That's... one way to put it," Lemres sighed. He said it in such a credulous manner. "You were very forceful with me yesterday. It wasn't right to do that. You have to realize."</p>
<p>Sig's eyes widened slightly, but otherwise, his face was unreadable. "I only wanted to help you feel better."</p>
<p>"I know. It's just. There were better ways to do that than... that. And you did come into my home uninvited. And then told me you were in love with me."</p>
<p>"I am. I don't feel like this about anyone else."</p>
<p>"This love of yours doesn't seem healthy. It's very... obsessed."</p>
<p>"Obsessed?" Sig's expression fell. "Am I? I don't really... know."</p>
<p>Lemres had gotten the idea through some of their conversations that he wasn't very in tune with other people. But he didn't realize it was this much. He still found that he couldn't be that mad. He didn't want to. But he also couldn't just forgive what happened. It had really hurt him. He needed to think about what to say next.</p>
<p>"I don't think you meant to hurt me, but you did. I need you to understand that. And I need you to understand that I.. I don't feel the same. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Sig had that far-off stare again. Had he heard what he said? He hoped so, but it was hard to tell. He wasn't sure what else he could say at this point.</p>
<p>"Ok," Sig finally spoke again, quiet and shriveled. He looked down at the ground before getting up and walking toward the doorway. "Goodbye," he muttered, then walked down the stairs.</p>
<p>That was the last time the two saw each other for quite some time. Life continued as normal from that day forward. Lemres continued working on his bakery, not letting anything get him down. Although he was now extra careful to lock up properly. And he wasn't sure why, but he got the feeling he should cover his curtains more often.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he would idly wonder about Sig. He did miss the conversation they used to have together, hearing all about his bugs and what sweets were their favorites. But he understood why he didn't come around anymore. Maybe it was for the best, but absence makes the heart grow fonder...</p>

                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Does this ending feel too off? I'm not really sure. I left it somewhat ambiguous on Sig's part, and it's open if they'll ever meeet again. Plus it totally sinks my own ship. Who does that!?</p><p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;">Having originally wanted to write a yandere story, I think this came out unusual. From what I've read these stories end up becoming kind of insane, but this feels more somber and disquieting. It was still interesting to write, and I got more words out of it than I was expecting. I hope someone is receptive to it.</p>
