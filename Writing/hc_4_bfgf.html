<ul><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">He likes listening to music,
	singing, adventuring, and writing. Best at focusing on these things.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Doesn't like talking out loud,
	especially with people he isn't close to. Will try to avoid it by
	making nonsensical noises. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Hums to himself a lot, plays with
	his pockets a lot.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Likely has a song stuck in his
	head at all times. Tends to get lost in his thoughts.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In general, he doesn't fear many
	things. Confidently dives head first into danger if it might be
	fun/in the way. Not realizing something is dangerous in the first
	place.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Sudden loud noises bother him
	immensely (thunder, large bells, etc.)</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Somewhat literal minded and might
	not pick up on metaphors or euphemisms in speech.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Though not very talkative he can
	write very eloquently and rhythmically. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">He doesn't like being touched for
	long periods of time. This is one of the few things that will make
	him nervous. With the exception of one person. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">He is very resourceful with his
	voice. Though high, it has a decent range.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Tends to forget belongings, and
	picks up weird objects.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Has a hard time giving attention
	to things he isn't interested in (subjects in school).</p>
</ul>

                    <ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">She is just as fearless (and dumb)
	as him and more outwardly reckless because she likely has actual
	means of protecting herself</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Always in motion. Fidgets when
	standing still, or moves along to a tune, in or outside of her head.
	She likes to dance.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Impatient, doesn't like waiting
	for long periods of time and groans a lot when bored.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Somewhat talkative, when she gets
	excited she can speak for a long time. Going on tangents or getting
	off topic.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Takes petty insults too personally
	and is prone to tears.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Dislikes small spaces/being
	restrained as she likes having room to move.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Likes scary and weird things like
	large spiders and centipedes and dark alleyways. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Usually using glamour to appear
	more human. <span style="text-decoration: none">This is because of
	&ldquo;true love&rdquo;. Seems like she wants to appear more average
	for her lover, possibly separate herself from her parents.</span></p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Also dislikes loud and sudden
	noises/discordant music.</p>
</ul>
                    <img src="/line-separator-clipart-31.png" style="width:756px" />
                    <ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">She is enamored with his writing
	and they like to write love letters to each other. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">She also encourages him to sing
	more. He tries to do the same but she doesn't seem very fond of her
	own voice.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">He admires her power and beauty
	and thinks she's very talented with music, and would like to see her
	express it more</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">He finds it much easier to talk to
	her than anyone else. She's the only person he'll let physically
	close to him. Enthusiastically, even.</p>
