                    <hr>
                    <p>Amy put her cold, wet clothes on the nearby chair, and joined Bark on the bed. He saw she was still shivering, so he held her closer to his chest. She was a bit surprised at first, but after a second she leaned into his warm fur.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she whispered softly. "I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there..." She sighs. "...someday, I'm going to be stronger. Strong enough that you won't have to save me anymore."</p>
<p>Bark hums in response. He brings his hand down to pet Amy's head. She closes her eyes and leans into his touch. They were so close to each other now. She found herself feeling flushed. Her heart raced, as if she were still in danger, even though she knew they were safe now. She wondered if Bark felt the same. She leaned lower down his chest, hugging his thighs.</p>
<p>"I'd... I'd like to try something. If it's ok?" she mumbles. Her hands start to move between his thighs. She feels him twitch underneath her. His hands begin to move as well, towards her own. They cover hers and continue to move down toward his groin. He nods slowly. It seemed like such an innocent gesture, yet she could see the lust burning within his eyes. Their hands continued moving downward until they reached down all the way.</p>
<p>Amy starts to rub Bark's crotch until his penis emerges from his sheath. Nervously, she moves a hand toward it, touching it softly and looking up to see his reaction. Bark exhales sharply as Amy places another hand on his length and begins stroking him slowly. She stares as it twitches in her hands; it felt so warm. She moves one hand down to the base, the other goes towards the tip. Experimentally she rubs it with her thumb while lightly squeezing the base.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Bark moans, and a bit of pre cum drips out from his cock. Amy blushes as she watches it drip. 'Seeing someone get like this over me...' she thinks to herself. She opens her mouth, sticking her tongue out to lick at the small drop of pre cum. She moves her other hand to the base and puts her mouth around the head. Looking back up at Bark, she sucks at it, more pre cum dripping out into her mouth. Bark moans louder, and places his hand on the back of Amy's head. As he holds her there, she looks up at him again, seeing how aroused he was getting by just sucking on his dick for a few seconds. Without hesitation, Amy wraps her lips tightly around his shaft and begins to suck hard. The feeling of something entering her throat makes Amy gag slightly, which causes Bark to let go of her head.</p>
<p>She gasps through her nose, holding onto his prick as she continues to move forward and take more inside. Her eyes widen when she realizes that if she keeps going, it would fill her throat completely. But still, despite her fears, she continues to try to swallow every inch of it. In the meantime, her hands remained at the base, rubbing in short strokes and occasionally squeezing at it. Bark's breaths became heavier. He tried to keep control of himself, trying not to thrust into her warm, eager mouth, in fear of hurting her. Amy moves her head back and then moves back forward a little quicker than before. Bark gasps at the motion. His cock twitches in her throat and strings of cum shoot down into her stomach. She lets out a light whine feeling the hot liquid fill her throat and mouth. Once done, she takes his cock out of her mouth and takes a breath. They both breathe in tired unison for a few minutes, until Amy starts giggling softly.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I can't deepthroat you yet," she says between laughs. "It feels too weird."</p>
<p>Bark smiles weakly, breathing heavily. After recovering, they lay together naked, panting quietly. Amy reaches out and touches Bark's chest gently, running her fingers along his fur. In turn, he runs his fingers through the quills on her back. He gently lifts her on top of him, closer to his face. She leans down to kiss him. The taste of his semen remains in her mouth, and he licks it up. Once they break the kiss, Bark leans up, still holding Amy in his arms. Then he lays her back on the bed. She lets out a surprised squeak as he leans over her, groaning. His eyes looked hungry. Her heart raced excitedly.</p>
<p>His face presses on her chest. She can hear him sniffing her as he moves further down her body. Once he reaches that wet slit below, he takes an extra long whiff, causing her to giggle again. He opens his mouth, his tongue lolling out. Amy nods enthusiastically after he looks back up at her. Then he goes back down, grips her legs, and takes a long lick of her labia. She cries out softly as his rough tongue rips across her sensitive flesh. A second later, she squirms under him, moaning loudly now. She wants more of him licking her pussy. With a loud moan, Amy spreads her thighs apart wider and arches her hips upward. Bark eagerly latches on to her clit once more and begins licking it furiously, making sure not to miss even the tiniest part of it. He alternates between gentle flicking and forceful plunges against its hood, driving her insane with pleasure.</p>
<p>"A-ah... Bark!" She yells his name in between her gasps and moans. Sensing her getting close, Bark dips his tongue deeper within her. It moves around her inner walls, lapping up the juices inside. Amy grips the sheets tightly, overcome with euphoria. She simultaneously squeaks and screams as her orgasm moves throughout her whole body. Bark continues licking, even as her cum splashes on his face. Once she comes down from the high, he moves back up as well, licking the liquid on his face. He lifts her into his arms again, his finger wiping away the tears from her vivid peak.</p>
<p>As he kisses her, Amy becomes aware that she has never felt anything like this. Before tonight, she had only been with one person: Sonic the Hedgehog. And although she loved him dearly, he did not have the same effect on her as this bear does. When she came here, all she wanted was to find a job, desperate to make some money to support herself. She knew how gentle and kind Bark really was, despite his line of work. But she never expected she'd fall madly in love with him...</p>
                    <img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" style="width:756px" />
                    <p>As the storm raged on outside, the two lovers lie side by side, looking at each other in awe. Both of them stare deeply into each other's eyes as they hold hands. There's no doubt anymore about who loves whom. Amy Rose snuggles up next to Bark, placing her head on his shoulder. She rests her arm over his torso. Their bodies feel so good, she could stay like this forever. She closes her eyes and sighs happily. Bark chuckles softly. Amy glances up to see what made the sound. She blushes as she sees his smile.</p>
<p>"Bark? Do you... do you have any place to stay?" she said. He cocked his head in confusion. She looks down as she continues, "If you don't, I have some room in my house. So you don't have to keep paying for these inns every night. She looks back up, seeing his eyes wide in shock. "...you know, I mean, I'm just saying. You're a nice guy and all, but I'm pretty much broke, and I wouldn't mind helping a... a close friend out. I'm a bit worried about your safety staying at those places..." She trails off, embarrassed. Bark closes his eyes and exhales, calming his nerves. Amy notices that his tail wags back and forth a bit.</p>
<p>"...Amy..." Bark murmurs. Amy turns her head towards him. His voice... it was deep, yet tender. It fit him perfectly. He turned his head away from her. She held his hand in response, and he turned his eyes back to her.</p>
<p>"Please? It's the least I can do after all you've done for me. And..." her grip tightened, "I'd also like to see you more often." She smiled shyly, resisting the urge to turn away herself.</p>
<p>Bark looks at her again. His heart ached at how adorable she was right now. Her cheeks were bright red and her lips were trembling slightly; she seemed nervous. But there's something else; there's something hidden behind those soft eyes of hers. "Ok... at least let me get you a scarf," he finally says.</p>
<p>Amy laughs and hugs his neck. "If you insist!"</p>
<p>Soon after, the two of them doze off in each other's arms. Bark feels warm, safe, and contented; everything seems alright in life now. As sleep overtakes him, his last thought is of Amy. She feels warm in his arms as well.</p>
