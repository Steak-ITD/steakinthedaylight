                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Requested by the guest Guesy, Amitie is nude in public. This one turned out pretty short.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Amitie wished she wasn't so clumsy sometimes. Then maybe she wouldn't get into situations like this, where she had to walk through town, completely naked, desperately trying not to be caught.</p>

<p>She felt so silly for losing her clothes in the woods. All she wanted was a nice resfreshing bath in the river, but it seems the local wildlife had other plans. A raccoon had taken her clothes, and by the time she noticed, it had already begun to run off, and she tripped over the wet branches trying to catch up.</p>

<p>At least some time had passed, and she wasn't wet anymore. But she was still naked in public. And there wasn't that much to hide behind; just a few street corners and signs. If she could just get back home, she could change, then everything would be fine.</p>

<p>Then, she saw it: the racoon that had taken her clothes. It still had her hat, the most important part of her wardrobe. Once it noticed her, they stared at each other for a bit. Amitie started slowly inching towards the raccoon, trying not to startle it as she reached out for her hat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the raccoon did not want to give it up so easily. As soon as she got close enough, it dashed away, and without thinking, Amite ran after it. She chased it all throughout town, attracting plenty of attention from the passerby.</p>

<p>When she finally caught it, she snatched the hat right out of its mouth, and put it back on. The raccoon left, and she was feeling pretty proud of herself... Until she noticed the crowd staring at her. That's right, she was still naked! And she couldn't hide it anymore. She laughed nervously. Maybe nobody recognized her?</p>

<p>Someone called out her name in surprise. Welp, time to start running again!</p>

<p>By the time she reached home, she was out of breath, and thoroughly embarrassed (and a bit cold). Once she got in and got clothed, she thought back to what just happened. It was one od the most humiliating things that had ever happened to her. But... it was also exciting. Sneaking around was kind of fun. Maybe she could try it again, in a less dire situation?</p>

<p>Nah, she was too clumsy to make it work.</p>
