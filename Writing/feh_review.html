<p>I am quite disappointed with the outcome. And the whole arc really, I mean... it's just lame to me, I guess.</p>

<p>Unlike Book 3 which worked ok but I felt would probably be better in a full Fire Emblem game, this one I don't think would work much at all... All of the dream-ceptions got both confusing and tiring. There was info I would have liked to know more about. Like how Alfonse and Bruno met? Way more interested in that than whatever happens to these damn butterfly people. Hey, remember that curse? Yeah, I don't blame you.</p>

<p>I don't like how in this book and the last, the main antagonists get killed. I mean in a regular Fire Emblem game yeah it makes sense they gotta die but in this game? They are killing concepts, gods basically. Hel was basically the Grim Reaper, she is Death, and they just kill her. Chapter 11 implies there might be actual consequences to this, cause yeah why wouldn't there be consequences to killing Death? But no it's a lie, apparently. And they kill the nightmare butterflies, one of whom is Peony's sister, I remember someone saying that wouldn't happen because of that, and yet here we are. Also, the king of dreams is apparently dead. So like, are dreams canceled too? Who even knows? I was extra disappointed after finding this out because not only could that have been something to lead up to the next book but it hinted at more lore. Not that I wanted Alfonse to be dead, just wanted a risk, I guess?</p>

<p>Honestly, I think the only things that didn't disappoint me were that we got some good refreshers and eventually 2 new beast units out of it, and Kiran is something of a unit now. Other than that I am so dejected about this book. Also, I don't like the implication that lewd dreams are inherently nightmares. What I hope for the next book: cool it on the new characters and focus on the ones we already have, like why are these gods messing with our heroes, doing all these events, like what is Thorr about, also please continue Book 1 for Pete's sake, add a free summon counter to event banners please and thanks.

<h2>Book V: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLouXpPXP-jvYuVc-sCZaZarKsRxqoHlwu" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLouXpPXP-jvYuVc-sCZaZarKsRxqoHlwu</a></h2>

<p>It was probably my favorite book by far, but it still lacks, mainly due to the presentation of the story in this game... they don't focus enough on it. They briefly mention how the machines are systematically powered by magic, and I like that method, I think it matches this world quite well considering the wide usage of it in FE. Though I wish it was elaborated on more, again the presentation doesn't really make way for that... I wonder if there could be a FEH art book someday.</p>

<p>Even still I think the world-building and history were stronger with this book than with the last 2. Also looking back the foreshadowing is pretty clear. Otr being really quick to disown Reginn and Eitri being so devoted to the first king, those details stand out to me knowing how the rest of the story plays out.</p>

<p>Though I still don't know how I feel about the entire event being planned out by Eitri, I suppose she does win in the end since the royal bloodline does regain rule. But she was the expert on the magic used to power the machines, and it's not made clear how they would cover for that. The last 3 chapters did feel pretty rushed.</p>

<p>I think Reginn is a very pitiable character. Basically, she has to find out her whole life was a lie, one of her brothers never loved her and she was part of a scheme to fix a kingdom. Pretty much a trauma conga line. I also like how she doesn't immediately become queen because she isn't ready and has no experience. Also, the way her expressions are drawn feels very genuine.</p>

<p>Finally, this arc has left some somewhat disturbing implications about summoning and what it could do to someone's mind, acknowledging that you are basically pulling someone from their home. I presume Fafnir was a "failure" because it drove him insane not having his proper memories, unlike our summons which mostly leave the characters intact. Other than them following your every command mostly without question.</p><h2>Ice and Flame (story link unavailable for now)</h2>

<p>So, this started interesting, seeing the other "gods" that live in this realm and what they're like. And the final conflict was interesting... but they completely backed out of concluding it. Two characters who had reached an understanding despite having been on opposing sides of a war were forced to fight to the death by higher beings who just see them as pawns. An apparent prophecy detailing who would win. There are many ways you could take this... but they don't take it anywhere! It's not concluded at all!</p>

<p>I suppose I can hope that this will eventually have a real conclusion, but they said 5 was the final part, so I'm not gonna count on it for now.</p><h2>Forging Bonds - Abyssal Light https://youtu.be/AmPdWppERLM</h2>

<p>Dude what a random time to send out lore implications. Though I suppose the Ashen Wolves finding this out makes a bit of sense.</p>

<p>So it would seem that the kingdom of Askr is stuck in endless war. Makes sense, they do seem to get caught up in all these conflicts, and continue to summon more and more people to help. And the fact that Loki actually comes to prevent them from getting info means she's hiding something big.</p>

<p>I really want this to be elaborated on. PLEASE in the next book. They can't just drop something like this and then leave it be, right?</p>

<p>Besides that, it was nice to see some characters actively rebel from fighting, even if only for a little while. Again it makes me wonder how much autonomy they lose after being summoned.</p>
