                    <h3>Debut: Super Mario Sunshine (2001)</h3>
                    <p>First on the list since I've like him since I was a kid. His voice, his design, his relationship with his dad, really appealed to me. All the koopas did, but he was the cutest one, and the most talented I find.</p>
                    <p>I found it interesting that he has big shoes to fill as an official prince and like to imagine how he would rule as king and even what he would be like as a teenager. I also wondered about his relationship with his mother; it appears to be nonexistent as he went along with his dad's saying about Peach being his mom. And I also imagined his relationships with the koopalings as his adoptive siblings. Even STILL I imagined (and even wrote) his relationship with his own Clown Car, which seemed to emote more than Bowsers. So there was a whole lot of story potential to me!</p>
                    <p>My fixation is not as strong and he's kind of in the background for me now but I thought it important to mention because for a major chunk of the time I was on Deviantart and Tumblr he was my fascination.</p>

                    <h3>Debut: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992)</h3>
                    <p>There's so much to like about Miles, its no wonder he's so popular. I related to his past of being bullied for being different both in appearance and personality, and have vented through him. I think his present of having friends who love him even if they don't always get him is inspiring. And he's so incredibly intelligent that I think he has a bright future ahead of him.</p>
                    <p>It's amazing how he still turns out so alltruistic and empathetic despite what he's went through. Of course I like to imagine scenarios where he... doesn't turn out so nice, but still has certain core traits, but twisted into something more "negative" or insidious. It's also fun to imagine him being an actual magical kitsune with powers like immortality and the ability to control electricity and technology.</p>
                    <p>Although I generally prefer the classic version, I think his roles in the Sonic Adventure games are my favorite portrayals of him. They most directly show his growth as a person, learning to not depend on Sonic and come into his own, and be self sufficient without him. Although Tails' Adventure shows him doing just that too; he took down an army basically by himself. And he made a robot that is also a submarine. I'd be proud of that.</p>

                    <h3>Debut: Sonic the Hedgehog CD (1993)</h3>
                    <p>The classic version of Amy is such an endearing character to me... she's both a cute girly girl and a tough girl that wants to prove she is capable of handling herself. I like that she's grown from a damsel in distress to that. Her love of hammers and cars is relatable to me as someone who is not very girlish. I also think her design is so cute!</p>
                    <p>She is one of the few characters who can see the good in people even as villains. I loved her respective interactions with Metal Sonic and Bark. I think her love for Sonic is much cuter than the modern version; instead of through anger and force, she wants him to see her own merits as a person. It makes her crush much more adorable.</p>

                    <h3>Debut: Fire Emblem If/Fates (2015).</h3>
                    <p>This character was probably my furry awakening, or rather just who got me more into animalistic characters. I enjoy those who still have a feral streak despite being a sapient, civilized being. He has nary a care in the world about collecting trash that interests him, even if it's gross to others. That's immediately gonna catch my interest. Even though his supports are kind of samey, and that's probably due to the game's writing, they are still enjoyable to me, and a couple of them do show a deeper more attentive side to him.</p>

                    <h3>Debut: Puyo Puyo Fever 2 (2005).</h3>
                    <p>Of all the characters here, he is probably the most like me and the closest to a kin I have. He is such an odd fellow in a cast full of Odd Fellows. I find his backstory fascinating and his personality relatable. Sig reads so much as on the spectrum like myself. Being both hard to read emotionally but also pretty blunt. Only 1-2 people can tell how he feels with accuracy. Rarely visually emoting in general. Absolutely obsessed over one or a group of things to the point of having encyclopedic knowledge about it, while everything else is kind of a struggle to learn. Being real passive about most things. Doing whatever feels good in the moment with little restraint. Jokes and sarcasm go right over his head. That's very much autism to me.</p>
                    <p>This series in general has so many fun character interactions and I love his nonchalance to most things, but also his devotion to his friends, which grows as the series continues. I also like his character song, which is about exploring the world at your own pace.</p>

                    <h3>Not as strong but still notable Hyperfixes.</h3>
                    <p>Sweetie Bird (Tiny Toon Adventures)-another cute girly girl who is also a massive bitch, awesome</p>
                    <p>Sonic the Hedghog (Rad Mobile)-i genuinely think his carefree attitude and sense of judtice is inspirational, i also like his classic attitude of not thinking of himself as a hero. shipped with Tails and Cream</p>
                    <p>Cream the Rabbit (Sonic Advance 2)-it's fun imagining how she grows up as a person. shipped with Tails and Sonic</p>
                    <p>Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates)-i got invested in their story in the conquest route the most, waning to do right by all but being forced into a bad situation and harsh choices</p>
                    <p>Amitie (Puyo Puyo Fever)-her joy is infectious, but there's also a little implied confidence issue that i'm attatched to</p>
                    <p>Lemres (Puyo Puyo Fever 2)-another character whom i can imagine as having anxiety and perhaps autism, and a vague but intriging backstory. shipped with Sig<p>
