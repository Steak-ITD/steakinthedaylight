                    <p>Why stop now? Why feel guilty about it now? It's already done. Too far to stop. Soft tan fur near his mouth. He bared his teeth and tore it apart. The fur in his mouth, the wet flesh under it. He chewed it up and rolled it along his tongue. He swallowed, lightly panting afterward. This was such ecstasy. In more ways than one.</p>
<p>Holding the body closer, he took another bite, faster, more ravenous. He almost forgot to chew before swallowing this time. He craved that meat so badly, craved the fleeting warmth, needed it deep down in his core, and lower still, he rubs himself upon his meal. Taking a lick of the blood inside. With more and more bites, more tears in the flesh, it slowly disappears, opening the body up. His panting became heavier, until it became moans, all inhibitions gone.</p>
<p>Bone met his tongue. The cage blocked him from his greatest prize. Reluctant to let his tight hug go, he lifted up slightly and put his hands on the cage. No need to worry about pain at this point. They snapped with a bit of force. He couldn't help but lick one and suck the blood from the broken tip.</p>
<p>Now those precious organs reveal to him, large swaths of meat waiting to meet his lips. He had to go for the biggest one, full of blood. No hesitation now. He ripped the veins that held the heart there. He needed it so, so badly... Yet when it was within his grasp, within reach of his drooling mouth, he could only stare.</p>
<p>This was <em>his</em> heart, after all. Something that had once brought <em>him</em> sweet life. He had to be a bit wistful about this. He didn't bite right away as his lips touched the heart. Laying a kiss on the organ, and a lick of the blood. Then finally he sank his fangs in.</p>
<p>More blood flooded his mouth, and he moaned louder, higher, and his legs shook. The taste, the texture, the sentiment, it all drowned him. He felt as if he were being consumed now. It was fair, wasn't it? For him to feel that way now after what he was doing. He deserved it, he deserved worse, but now wasn't the time, now wasn't the time to worry about the Hell he would surely be led to. Now he just wanted to indulge, pay his lost friend the respect <em>he</em> deserves as a meal. <em>He</em> deserved so much more, nothing left behind but clean white bones, left with his friend, his love, forever.</p>

It was written in a spur of the moment, so it's not connected to anything and is generally freaky. I later edited it for grammar and spelling. I can't remember what mood I was in when I wrote this but it had been a concept on my mind for about a week or more, and sometimes I need to write these things out or they literally rot my brain.</p>
