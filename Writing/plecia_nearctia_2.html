                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> more stalking, and home invasion</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Sig came by the bakery fairly often. Always there to observe Lemres as much as he could. They even began talking to each other about things other than baked goods. Sig memtioned his affinity for arthopods, particularly insects. And Lemres had told him how he came to move here and own the building, following his dreams.</p>
                    <p>They wouldn't always be alone, though. Sometimes, there were other customers, other regulars whom Lemres would strike conversations with. He seemed to enjoy their company, too. Which made Sig feel... something, deep down in his gut. A twisting feeling. He ignored it for now.</p>
                    <p>It wasn't such a big deal, anyway. They would have their own "moments" alone at nighttime, when Sig would climb that same tree, now equipped with binoculars, to look through the window properly. He learned that Lemres could cook more than just baked goods, though it seemed to be his main passion. He also liked to read books, though what about he still couldn't make out, unfortunately. Most of all, he had a certain grace to everything he did. With every emotion on his lovely face. It was entrancing to watch. No wonder he had so many regulars. He was just. Gorgeous. In every sense.</p>
                    <p>Even at home, Sig would still think about him. Things he never thought of another human. He found himself undressing Lemres with his mind, imagining what his bare legs looked like, what his belly felt like. He imagined the two of them hugging, just being so close together, sharing their warmth. He imagined joining their bodies together, stuck like two honeymoon flies. It was overwhelming thinking these things. These feelings were so new to him. But it felt right. Being with him. It felt right.</p>
                    <p>On another average day, the two were talking as they usually did. While Lemres was putting the finishing touches on a cake, Sig noticed his touch wasn't as precise as it usually was. It was a bit shaky. "Is everything okay?" he asked.</p>
                    <p>"W-what do you mean?"</p>
                    <p>"You seem nervous. Your grip is shaky."</p>
                    <p>"Oh," Lemres laughed nervously. "Is it that obvious? I am nervous about something." He put his supplies down. "I'm meeting with my parents tonight. They... don't believe in my dreams. They think it's a waste of time."</p>
                    <p>"I see." Sig knew this feeling. He wasn't well understood by his family either, and he too valued his freedom to do as he pleased as an adult. It was something that the two of them had in common.</p>
                    <p>"I'm trying not to let it deter me, though," Lemres continued. "I want to show them how successful I've been so far. I'm happy doing this, and I've made great friends. Like you!"</p>
                    <p>Sig felt his face warm at that. He liked being described as a friend, but a longing feeling came back to him. He put it aside for a second. "Thank you, Lemres. I think of you as a good friend too. I'm sure your meeting will go well.</p>
                    <p>Lemres smiled, that gorgeous glowing smile. "Thanks. I'll make sure it does," he said, determined.</p>
                    <p>Later, instead of the usual tree he climbed, Sig walked by the bakery. He didn't know where Lemres was meeting his family, so he couldn't watch to make sure things went well. He sighed and pressed his hand on the door to the bakery. As his thoughts began to wander as usual, he felt a lack of resistance. The door was unlocked.</p>
                    <p>Sig was confused. Why was it unlocked? Was Lemres in a rush to leave? That was the only thing that made sense. He should probably just close the door and leave.</p>
                    <p>But he felt a longing.</p>
                    <p>Slowly, he pushed open the door. Of course, it was empty. It was strange seeing the room so dark. It made him feel a bit sad. Now would be a good time to just leave. There was no reason to stay...</p>
                    <p>...the left door was hanging open. He stared. There really was a rush to leave, wasn't there? Maybe Sig should just close it and the main door. Do his ...friend, a secret favor. And then go home.</p>
                    <p>But the longing remained.</p>
                    <p>This... was a rare opportunity. He could learn even more about Lemres. Become even closer.</p>
                    <p>So, slowly, he walked into the doorway and up the stairs. He, of course, found another open door. He didn't think twice about this one. A sweet scent filled his nose, just like the bakery during the day. His home was very neat; the kitchen in particular looked spotless. The room was painted a soft natural green, accented by an orange couch. It was just as geacious as the one who lived here.</p>
                    <p>Sig walked around a bit. He noticed on the table the books that Lemres like to read: cookbooks, local history, fantasy novels. He smiled, finally knowing more about what he liked. He decided to explore more, seeing yet another open doorway. His bedroom.</p>
                    <p>It didn't look neat like the rest of his house, likely because of the rush. Still, it had a cozy atmosphere. It made Sig blush, being so close to where Lemres spent his most intimate moments. He wished he was here right now. Smelling the sweet scent that must be permeating off him by now. He thought again about touching his soft skin amongst his sheets. He thought of the same happening to him.</p>
                    <p>Lemres' hands touching his body in ways he would never let anyone else. Smooth, delicate hands kneading him like they would cookie dough. Breaths hot on his skin, his name upon his lips...</p>
                    <p>"Sig?"</p>
                    <p>...that wasn't in his head.</p>
