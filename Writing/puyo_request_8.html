                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Requested by the guest Pp√±, Risukuma makes a potion that ends up turning him and Ai into himbos. For the sake of ease just imagine Ris is actually a squirrel bear and not in a costume.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Risukuma was nearly finished with what could possibly be his greatest achievement yet. Ai watched carefully as he added the finishing touches to the brightly colored potion.</p>

<p>"It's done!" Ris held the bottle of pink liquid up high. "With one sip of this, we shall become intelligent beyond compare, able to learn the secrets of science!"</p>

<p>"Is this one safe?" Ai stared at the bottle, noticing how bubbly the liquid was. "It seems a bit volatile."</p>

<p>"I assure you, all the ingredients are safe for consumption," Ris says, then takes a swig of the potion. He hands it over to Ai, who takes it slowly. He sniffs at the liquid. It smells extremely sweet. He downs the rest of it.</p>

<p>They wait for a few minutes for something to happen.</p>

<p>"Hmm... I think I feel something changing in my head..." Ris said. In fact, he was feeling kind of heavy. He looked over at Ai, who was holding his head. He too seemed a little different. His chest was puffed out a bit. Risukuma looked down and saw his was too. Perhaps a side effect of the potion.</p>

<p>But when their chests continued expanding, Ai began to whine. Ris also noticed his behind getting bigger, more obvious and shapely. It was quite... Enticing? Huh? Wait, something <i>was</i> happening to his brain. As he kept staring at Ai's changes, he found it harder to think about anything else but how cute he was. He looked down at his own body again and realized he was going through similar changes.</p>

<p>Yet it all felt so natural. Even though his hips had expanded, he didn't feel any struggle to stand. That was weird, right? But it didn't feel weird. It felt just fine. Wait, no, it <i>is</i> strange! Thinking logically was getting harder and harder.</p>

<p>No, no, this wasn't supposed to happen! He had to think fast, what was in that potion? Ris tried to remember, but the words were too complex for him now. It was too tiring. He just wanted to think of something... Simple. Like how squishy Ai's muzzle had become. It must feel so nice. He wished his muzzle would become like that. He touched it, and realized his wish had already come true: he had a big fluffy snout, ripe for kissing. Yay!</p>

<p>His body kept expanding out, to an almost comical degree. His pecs grew larger than his own head, hips jutting out with soft fat. It all felt so natural. He loved it.</p>

<p>"Hey Ris, I think your potion worked! Look at how adorable I am!" Ai barked, having gone through a similar change. Every part of him looked so big and huggable and squishy. He mentioned a potion, though. Is that what caused this? Yeah... He used to be able to make those. It must have worked really well. What else could he have used it for?</p>

<p>Those thoughts were too hard now. All Risukuma wanted to do was feel his new body. He jumped up and down, feeling his fat flesh jiggle with each movement. Ai joined him. They held hands, jumping up and down together, not a worry in the world.</p>

<p>Then they stopped and decided to hug and kiss each other. It was a very sloppy kiss, their snouts being so big dripped tons of saliva as their tongues met each other and twisted all around. All the while they squeezed and slapped their bodies together. This was so much fun.</p>

<p>But it was getting kind of hot in that small room. "Hey, let's go outside and play some more!" Ris said, and Ai nodded his head in agreement. They left the room, knocking over a bunch of equipment with their huge bodies. Of course, they didn't notice anything around them. They were just too excited to try out their bodies with each other.</p>
