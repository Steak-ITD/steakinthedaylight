                    <h2>Original Canon</h2>
                    <img src="/Images\Sketches\extra\siglem.jpeg" class="responsive">
                    <p>Lemres has always been careful towards Sig and his situation. Sig is suspicious of him, though. I imagine he will get to know him better soon. And realize Lemres is kind of sheltered and isn't aware how he comes off to others, and they're similar in that way. They are also both free spirits at heart. I like how their character somgs both about exploration in different vibes. One about doing so at your own slow pace while everyone else moves so fast. The other is about trying not to be afraid of what you find and learn what you're looking for. I think they'll rub off on each other.</p> 
                    <p>Some headcanons: Lemres is kind of a celebrity, but he doesn't act like it and rarely lets it get to his head. He probably gets caught doing weird things more often than other celebrities would. Sig is a more reserved person, so it bugs him a little when he is also caught up in this. He's not one for PDA either and prefers private shows of affection, like they do when being intimate. Lemres tries to be more careful talking about his relationship when being interviewed.</p>
                    <p>Sig stims with steady consistent noises. Fans, the beat of a fly's wings, a cricket's chirps. Heartbeats. When they are relaxed together, Sig will lean into Lemres' chest and listen to his heartbeat. Lemres holds him close, keeping his breath steady, sometimes humming lullabies to let him sleep easier. I think of them both as slight, but Lemres has a little chub from eating so much candy. It's on his belly, and it's fun to hug.</p>
                    <p>Sig is only somewhat of a pillow princess. He'll fall asleep sometimes during sex but other times, be surprisingly energetic and willing to take action to move something along. Lemres' doting nature carries over to sex; he's always reaffirming that everything is ok. It comes a bit from anxiety. Neither are very loud, Sig is a moaner while Lemres gasps a lot. They are willing to leave marks on each other but only for each other, not much willing to show off.</p>
                    <p>I like to think of empathy between them. Since Lemres knows what's happening with Sig, the demon taking his personality away is a scary thought to them both. Lemres can relate to wanting to live life as you please, but having someone else stopping you. Sig, too, is particularly empathetic, though he doesn't show it very well, I think he would get how Lemres feels about his former life and feel sorry for him.</p>

                    <h2>Reverse/Increased Age Gap</h2>
                    <img src="/Images/Sketches/extra/reverselemsig.jpeg" class="responsive">
                    <p>Lemres is a lonely boy with few friends who finds Sig to be an interesting change of pace from his normal life and admires how he follows his passion freely. Sig is an introvert adult also with few friends who find Lem annoying at first but becomes more familiar with him and his situation and grows to like him more. I guess it's not super different from the regular version but the bigger age difference does change the dynamic a bit, no? In this version Sig has more of the "caretaker" role being older and more "put together" so to speak. He wants Lemres to learn to be more self accepting, independent, not so nervous all the time. And Lemres does feel more free to be himself around Sig. He's a soothing presence.</p>
                    <p>I'm imagining their ages as 8-9 for Lem and about 25 for Sig, and their appearance is based on the mini/mega forms from PP7 respectively.</p>

                    <h2>Darkling Demon</h2>
                    <img src="/Images/Sketches/extra/darkling.jpeg" class="responsive">
                    <p>This AU features Dark/Black Sig. Lemres and Akuma are his caretakers and keep him from falling into chaos like his other half. Akuma enlists the help of Lemres because he is a promising talent despite still being an apprentice. He also seems to know something about demons and their magic, and could help Sig learn to control his own.</p>
<p>Sig still has his other friends, and his state makes him easier to understand a little. He is more visibly and audibly emotional. He is still blunt though, stating his feeling and thought plainly. It's a bit of a shock to him.</p>
<p>His state runs in his family and so he is more aware of his heritage as a half-demon, but not of being a reincarnation of the original demon's body... I don't have any frame of reference for his family. Something happened to them to put him in the care of Lemres and Akuma.</p>
<p>I still think of him as autistic, and very very particular about touching. It's overwhelming to be touched on his non demon skin, it makes him shiver and shrink away. Only the two people closest to him can touch him there and even then it has to be light and soft, like how a bug feels crawling on him. He likes when bugs crawl on him, as well as the buzzing noises they make, and is extra gentle with them.</p>
<p>He feels most attached to Lem in the way they do because he's known him the longest, he's doted over him for years, so he doesn't have much reason not to trust him more than canon (but he still thinks his habits are weird). They are both also careful bout their friends regularly, so I think that it rubs off on Sig more. He would be like the kind of embarrassing dad of his friend group.</p>
<p>Sig can be kind of handsy with Lemres, being just about the only person he's close to. He has to be gentle though, his arms are so strong, he could hurt someone! But sometimes that extra... energy, builds up, and he feels these urges to scratch, and growl, and purr. Lem ends up being a target for this aggression, covered in bruises and scratches that he has to heal with magic. But he doesn't seem to mind much, seeing it as another way of helping. Yet he feels inclined to keep it a secret.</p>
<p>Lemres feels devoted to raising him well because he left his own family to follow his dreams, and he wants Sig to be able to do that too, live without that kind of pressure. He is encouraging of his admittedly small amount of habits. Their relationship seems deeper than something familial though but doesn't lean all the way into romance.</p>
<p>I think most of the events of the various stories would still hapoen mostly the same way, I'm not sure as I am still going through them. His story conclusion in 20th might end differently, like he would get a different answer from Accord.</p>

                    <img src="/Images/Sketches/extra/sigbuglemrat.jpeg" title="Sig Bug Lem Rat" class="responsive">
                    <p>Miscellaneous, not as deep AUs, mainly just me turning my faves into Creatures.</p>
                    <h4>Beetle/Rat & Sphinxes</h4>
                    <p>Sig is a beetle (or a dragonfly), Lemres is a rat.</p>
                    <h4>Ruki/Meerca (Neopets)</h4>
                    <p>Sig is a Ruki, Lemres is a Meerca. Also, Amitie is a Xweetok.</p>
                    <h4>Animals</h4>
                    <p>Weird little humanoid sphinx creatures I made up mainly for fetish purposes. The types of animal are indistinct but Sig is reptilelike and Lemres is more catlike.</p>
                    <h4>Siren/Sailor</h4>
                    <p>Sig is a flying fish siren. A lonely boy kept company by the few aquatic bugs and animals on his island.</p>
                    <p>Lemres is a culinary sailor, known in some lands for his delicious sweets. He's always seeking to improve and make new things, which is why he travels. One day, while lost at sea, he hears a beautiful, yet melancholy song... It seems to know exactly what's on his mind. <i>A gourgeous land untouched by modern day, all the sweet food you could ever need. Ingredients year round, ready to be picked and cooked.</i></p>
                    <p>Allured by the song, unaware of what a siren even is, he finds the island, full of fruiting plants and herbs, flowers and trees... blocked only by the large sharp rocks and steep cliffs surrounding it. It's painful to climb, but that song. He has to know the source. And he finds the siren Sig, who is happy to have found someone. He wants to keep the sailor here. After all, the island has everything he needs, plus the cooking supplies he brought. There's no reason to leave, right?</p>
                    <p>But Lemres does leave eventually, wanting to share his new recipes with more people. Even as he does, the influence of the siren's song never really leaves him. It brings him back to the island repeatedly (which he keeps as his own little secret, saying it's to protect the wildlife). He shares sweets with Sig, as well as stories of his journeys. Sig is content having him there, listening to his voice, eating his treats. Each time Lemres comes back, he stays just a little longer. Each time, Sig's songs lead him back. He doesn't become aware of this immediately, and as he does, he finds he doesn't mind the idea of staying there, keeping his little friend company forever...</p>
                    <p>As his cooking becomes more renowned, others begin to wonder just why it's as good as it is. They suspect he's hiding something. But nobody else is able to find that special island, only getting lost in fog or avoiding the sharp rocks. And those who do hear the young siren's song know better. Perhaps he lacks the experience to allure others. Perhaps Lemres is simply naïve. It doesn't matter, as time goes on. They have each other now.</p>
