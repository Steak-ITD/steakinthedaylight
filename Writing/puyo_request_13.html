                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Requested by KatesKrab, Lemres drugs and rapes Klug. Uh, this has been on AO3 for a while, sorry.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Klug bit eagerly into the large cookie Lemres had given him. It was perfection; just the right amount of soft, the right temperature, and wonderfully sweet. He could feel the chocolate melt in his mouth.</p>

<p>"How is it?" Lemres asked with confidence knowing the answer.</p>

<p>"Perfect, as always!" Klug said, and took another bite. His only complaint was that there wasn't more to enjoy.</p>

<p>Lemres watched intently as Klug finished. "Glad to hear that. I made it especially for you."</p>

<p>Klug couldn't help but blush. Immediately he felt silly for doing so, after hearing such a simple statement. He looked away and chuckled, feeling the heat in his cheeks continue to rise. "W-well then! I should probably get going soon. I have lots of studying to do, you know." He got up, only to have his wrist grabbed.</p>

<p>"Do you have to go so soon?" Lemres said. He was rather close, and his expression was sorrowful. "I mean, I can help you study."</p>

<p>Klug's blush continued to grow. He would usually be too prideful to ask for help with work, but if it was Lemres... He chuckled again, suddenly feeling his nerves.</p>

<p>"Are you alright, Klug? You look a bit... calescent," Lemres pointed out.</p>

<p>"Do I?" Come to think of it, Klug was feeling quite a bit hotter than before. His breaths felt thicker, and he had a strange feeling in his abdomen. Did he come down with something?</p>

<p>"Come with me. I think you need to relax a bit." Lemres pulled Klug away, still holding onto his wrist. They went deeper into his abode. Klug's legs were shaky; he felt he could barely walk all the way there.</p>

<p>He was sat down on a bed. But he quickly decided he needed to lay down. It felt a little better than standing, at least. But the dizziness remained. He felt like he was melting.</p>

<p>Lemres put a hand on his forehead. "You're very hot," he said softly. "Here, let me..." His hands moved to Klug's chest, and he started opening his vest up.</p>

<p>"Oh, that won't b-be necessary-" Klug found it increasingly harder to move. He couldn't stop Lemres from pulling the vest away, or lifting his shirt up. It didn't really help with the heat. If anything, he felt hotter, and more nervous.</p>

<p>"There there, just relax," Lemres cooed, rubbing his hands on Klug's midsection. "Let me take care of you."</p>

<p>Klug was silent. It was hard to speak, hard to stay focused. He couldn't move. And he was being touched in a way he would describe as *sensual*. Things were not right.</p>

<p>"Lemres..." He tried to speak up, theough it was slow and quiet. "Lemres, what did you put in that cookie?"</p>

<p>Lemres looked at him with a small grin. "I can't get anything past you, huh? Like I said, I made it especially for you."</p>

<p>That didn't really answer his question, but his fleeting focus shifted when he felt his pants being pulled down. He wanted to move away, but whatever he had ingested inhibited his ability. "I... I don't..." He felt his heart pound. This powerlessness hurt so much.</p>

<p>Hands move up and down his sides. Lackadaisical but firm, feeling him up. Slipping off his own pants, Lemres eventually got on top of him, taking off his underwear, dropping all pretense of what this was. Klug shut his eyes, wishing he would just faint already, so he didn't have to experience this betrayal. But they opened again as he moaned, feeling the hands on his member, moving as they did before, easily making him hard.</p>

<p>Klug guessed that the cookie must have had an aphrodisiac as well as whatever drug made him feel so tired, explaining this unwanted pleasure.</p>

<p>That was all he had to distract him from the present moment. He couldn't move anything but his eyes, and he could only look at his own penis being rubbed against his will, his assailant's penis just above dripping onto him, or stare at the ceiling. None of these options were particularly nice, but the ceiling was preferred.</p>

<p>His legs twitched slightly as the motions slowed down and eventually stopped. But Klug wasn't foolish enough to think this was over. After all, neither of them had reached their "climax".</p>

<p>Something wet was rubbed onto his member. He didn't want to look. But as something tight and warm began to touch the tip, he felt he had no choice. He looked to see Lemres lowering himself onto his wet cock. It entered roughly at first, then smoothly went down into him.</p>

<p>He got his answer, so he looked back up at the ceiling, trying to ignore the sounds of moaning, and the feeling of skin slapping his crotch, and the tightness around his cock. He tried, but what else was there to focus on?</p>

<p>Eventually Klug starts moaning too, his body giving him some kind of sick thrill from this. How shameful, he thought. His disgust in himself rises as he reaches his peak, filling the other with small spurts of semen. Lemres came soon after, covering Klug's chest in white. If he could move better, he would probably cringe.</p>

<p>When Lemres got off him, cum dripping out of his hole, he looked at Klug , who had  his eyes closed again. "Let me get something to clean you up," he said, then left the room. Klug sobbed. He didn't know how to feel. He wished he could feel nothing.</p>

<p>At the very least he harbored resentment that there apparently wasn't enough drugs in the cookie to fully knock him out. Then he wouldn't have had to experience this. He could just have been asleep and none the wiser. But no, now his memory of his friend was tarnished.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes closed when Lemres came back. He said nothing when he spoke to him, pretending to be asleep, and hoping that he would eventually sleep for real, and think of this all as a bad dream.</p>
