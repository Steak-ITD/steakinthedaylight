                    <p>"You have quite a talent with that mouth. Now show me what else you can do with it..."</p>

<p>Of course they'd word it that way. Boyfriend grimaced at the cock in front of him. He wanted to get this over with, but he needed to be convincing.</p>

<p>He shoved his mouth down halfway, leaving his tongue to lap under the head. He put a hand at the base and stroked.</p>

<p>This was just a means to an end. If he wanted to perform, he had to do this. It wouldn't be forever... not that it made him feel much better.</p>
