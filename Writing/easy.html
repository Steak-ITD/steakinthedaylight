                    <p>It should have been easy.</p><p>Sure, Pico had a history with him. But it was just that. Past. It didn’t <em>matter</em> anymore.</p><p>He had a clear shot. That idiot probably wouldn’t move out of the way if he walked right up to him, gun in hand.</p><p>He should have jumped at the chance to kill him. And yet…</p><p>Even with the hatred he felt, the hurt at seeing him smile, just for a second, he couldn’t help but think back.</p><p>To when that smile was for him.</p><p>His finger hovered over the trigger.</p><p>It was never going to be easy.</p>
