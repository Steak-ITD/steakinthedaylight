                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Major Character Death caused by being beaten with a bat</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> This is some AU where Sig is descended from the original demon, but doesn't have the demon arm. Maybe it hasn't appeared *yet*, maybe it never would have, it's not important. What matters is he seems normal and has no idea what or why this is happening.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Today started out pretty average. A sunny cloudless day, which was Sig's favorite, since he could see the blue sky clearly. It always relaxed him to look up, and he sure could use some relaxation. He felt so wound up lately. School was stressing him out. It was probably something he could deal with, but right now he didn't want to think of it.</p>

<p>Now was time to be calm. Think of nice things, like the planes and birds up high. How the sky matched his two eyes. He was amused by such small things, but that didn't bother him.</p>

<p>He had almost fallen asleep when he felt a tickle on his nose. Opening his eyes and sitting up, he saw a big ladybug fly around him. It was a light orange-tan color with black spots. His eyes followed it closely, before it went of in its own direction.</p>

<p>Why, of course he had to follow it. Ladybugs this size and color were quite rare. He trailed the bug as close as he could without scaring it, following it through the town, into grassy plains.</p>

<p>The ladybug landed on some flowering plants, under a leaf. Sig noticed there were a couple of aphids underneath as well. So the ladybug had been looking for lunch. As he watched it on the hunt, he thought to himself it wouldn't be such a bad idea to eat himself. He always forgot to bring his own food, so he would have to buy something.</p>

<p>As he wondered what he was in the mood for, someone began to approach from the few trees not to far from the spot. This someone had been expecting him. Not quite so soon, and not quite in this way. It was a surprise, but not an unwelcome one. Now was as good a time as any to take action.</p>

<p>The figure made a slow approach, not making enough noise for Sig to notice, so entranced by the ladybug and the flowers. By the time he did hear something coming,  he barely had time to react. He had just slightly turned his head when a cloth was moved directly over his mouth. He gasped, inhaling whatever scent was on the cloth. He tried to struggle, but realized another arm was holding him. His struggles got weak faster and faster as he kept hyperventilating into the cloth, breathing in more of the fumes. Eventually it became too much, and he blacked out.</p>

<p>Sig came to in a much different place than he was before. Instead of a clear blue sky, there was a concrete ceiling. The floor was equally as gray and rough looking. The air itsrlf felt somewhat stale, as did the single light dangling in the middle of the room. When he tried to move, he realized he too was dangling from the ceiling. His wrists were in chains, his feet didn't touch the floor, and he leaned against the wall.</p>

<p>What exactly was going on? He remembered being outside, just looking at a ladybug, and then suddenly restrained? Had he done something wrong? Maybe he walked onto someone's private property by accident? Some people got really upset about that, but this seemed like a bit much.</p>

<p>He heard some voices coming from the other side of the door. "... a shock to find it so soon, so I grabbed it as quickly as I could."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's good, but you should have been keeping a closer eye."</p>

<p>The door opened, revealing two figures, both with face masks obscuring them, and wearing long sleeved dark clothing.</p>

<p>"There it is," said a masculine sounding voice. "Was actually pretty easy to set up."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it," said the other voice, a higher pitch than the first one. She seemed to have something behind her back.</p>

<p>The attire and attitude of the two figures confused Sig even more. Everything was so dark and gloomy. He didn't really want to be here, especially not hanging like this.</p>

<p>"Um, hello," he said meekly. "Who are you? Why am I here?"</p>

<p>The two masked individuals looked his way. It was hard to tell what expressions they had on.</p>

<p>"We are heroes," the male one stated plainly.</p>

<p>"Tonight, we save our land." the female finished. She began to walk closer to Sig. The item she held behind her back was slowly revealed as a heavy bat, nailed sloppily running through it.</p>

<p>More confusion and fear struck him as the masked woman approached. "What do you mean? How am I..." he couldn't stop staring at the bat. Unconsiously he began shaking, trying to move away despite his restriction. He didn't like where this was going, but he couldn't figure out what to do or say.</p>

<p>"I know what you are." the woman continued, "What you're going to do if we don't end it now." She lifted the bat up, getting ready to swing.</p>

<p>"Wait, I don't know what you're talking about-" the chains rattle with Sig's shaking, and his breath quickens. Before he can finish, the woman swings, hitting his stomach, knocking the air out of him. He immediately felt like throwing up. Guess it was good he hadn't eaten anything. Instead, tears formed in his eyes.</p>

<p>The woman just looked at him, once again no expression apparent on her masked face. She reared up for another swing. "This is for the good of the world."</p>

<p>"N-no, don't!" But Sig's exclamation did nothing to stop the next swing to his stomach. The nails pierced his skin as the bat hit, causing him to scream. Then they were torn out, and blood leaked from the wounds. His shaking became more pronounced, and the tears slide down his face.</p>

<p>Before he could react, there was another swing, this time to his chest. It didn't seem to hurt as much, but perhaps he was still realing from the last. There was little time for that though, as yet another swing hit him, and the nails cut through him again. A piece of skin ripped away with a bent nail as the bat was pulled away.</p>

<p>The hits became faster and faster, bruising and tearing his chest and stomach. He kept yelling and crying as it continued, pain becoming more and more unbearable. He started to cough up blood, which landed on the assailant. If she noticed, she showed no signs of it.</p>

<p>He almost didn't realize when the hitting had finally stopped. By now he was sure his bones were broken, and he was bleeding internally. If he ever got out of this, he would surely be damaged for life. And even if not, the memory alone would haunt him forever.</p>

<p>Why did this happen? He had never met these people, he never hurt anyone intentionally. He thoughy he was well behaved. What did he do to deserve this?</p>

<p>"Wasn't something supposed to, you know, come out?" the male voice said.</p>

<p>"Maybe." The lady responded. "Perhaps it hasn't found that power yet."</p>

<p>They were talking about him, saying all these weird things about powers and saving the world... How could any of this be good?</p>

<p>"Please.. Just let me go... I want to go home..." he sobbed.</p>

<p>"Sorry, we can't let that happen." And that was the last thing the woman said, before swinging again, harder, more haphazardly. Hitting his chest, his belly, even his face.</p>

<p>This was it, this was really it. Sig was going to die here, and he didn't know why. He didn't want to accept it, but what else could he do now, in this dingy basement at who knows where? He would die here, and no one else would know where he went. Not his friends, or his classmates, or his bugs.</p>

<p>He wanted to scream, and cry, and beg, and he tried, but eventually only gurgling blood came out. He fought to keep consciousness, but everything slowly faded to black. He could barely even think by the time his pierced and beaten organs finally failed. He passed on, confused and hurt.</p>

<p>"It's done. The demon is dead." The woman sighed in relief.</p>

<p>"Now what?"</p>

<p>"Now, we find the crimson soul and destroy it as well."</p>

<p>"But will it really matter since we destroyed the azure soul? They can't meet now."</p>

<p>"Better to be safe than sorry."</p>

                        The people who find him had been stalking him for a bit. They are like a  demon hunting cult. Lead mainly by their fear and not very rational. 
                        
                        Anyway, Sig happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The story's theme is pretty much in the title. It's plain unlucky. There is confusion and sadness and hurt that doesn't need to happen, but it does, and that sucks... 
                        
                        There isn't too much more meaning to it other than the catharsis of making gore of my comfort character.</p>
