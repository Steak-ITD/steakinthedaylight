<p>It didn't cross her mind at first. Amite thought her belly getting bigger was due to her appetite increasiing so much. After her clothing stopped fitting and her back was hurting more, she put together that she was pregnant.</p><p>She figured out when it happened too; that fun time she had with that Owlbear. She was wearing a cool blue outfit, one that made her want to run as fast as possible. It also made her feel bolder than usual. She'd shown herself off to the cute mammal, flirting all the while. She dared it to catch her and lifted her skirt, revealing wet lios and no panties. After that, Owlbear caught her rather quickly.</p><p>It mounted her from behind and pounded her hard and fast. That was how she came as well. The combination of the Owlbear's long cock and hot cum made her feel incredibly full. To her surprise it turned her around and started thrusting again.White hot liquid spilled out of and around her, By the time it was done and they had both come again, her pussy looked like a spilt cream puff. Owlbear indulged itself by licking her body clean, and she licked its dick clean in return.</p><p>No, pregnancy hadn't been on Amitie's mind at all. She didn't even think it would be possible. Now, it was all she could think about. The pregnancy had lasted a pretty short time by human standards. Not long after her water broke, Owlbear had come to her again. Perhaps it knew this might be a possibility?</p><p>It let her lean against it, and let her grab its paw as tightly as she wanted when her contractions became too much to bare. She tried not to scream feeling her cervix stretch, but it hurt so much. She yelped as the baby moved down her canal. Pushing it out wasn't so bad at least. It was a small little critter, and after its head popped out, the rest came much easier.</p><p>Looking at the new small owlbear filled both parent with elation. Amitie brought it up to her small chest, which was leaking with milk. The baby eagerly latched onto her nipple. The beak was a little sharp, but compared to the pain she just went through, it was nothing. But then she noticed her tummy still looked rather large... could it be? And just like that, the pain came back, and she prepared herself again. It wasn't as hard this time to birth the second owlbear now that she was used to it and knew what to do. It didn't make it less painful, but it seemed to go by quicker, and she finally relaxed knowing the difficult part was over.</p><p>Amitie held her twin babies as close as she possibly could while they drank from her full breasts. Owlbear hooted happily from behind her. Even though the idea hadn't crossed her mind until recently, she swore to herself then that she would become a wonderful mother.</p>
