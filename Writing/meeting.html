                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Was feeling an art block of sorts with drawing so I decided to write instead. I couldn't even cross 1000 words with this though, so strange my writing style is sometimes. The end notes contain references for the characters in this story, it's a reverse age au with Sig and Lemres as animals.</p>

                    <p>“I finally got away,” Lemres said to himself. He no longer heard the scurrying of the butlers chasing him. However, having lost them, the young rat realized he had gotten lost himself. Surrounded by flowers and trees he didn't recognize, he started slowly inching forward.</p><p> Admittedly, seeing a new site was kind of exciting. He hardly had a chance to leave his home. Unaware of the area, he didn't realize just how quiet it was, until he wondered why he hadn't seen anyone else. And then, a sound. A quickly approaching sound, like the wind.</p><p>It came from above him; a hungry hawk looking for a rare treat. Anything else around had been hiding. Lemres froze, too shocked to think. Time was running out, he should move, or use a spell, but his limbs wouldn't listen-</p><p>“Cyan!”</p><p>Again before he knew what was happening, a blast of blue magic came in his direction and hit the bird above. It fell to the ground. Finally able to move, Lemres darted away. Hearing someone call to him, he lept toward the sound. He was pulled aside into a small hole with a beetle. Then his mouth was covered. So he listened outside. He heard a bit of rustling, then a fluttering that got farther away. Relieved, he let out a sigh against the hand on his mouth, which moved away.</p><p>“Are you okay?” a soft voice came from the larger beetle. He was as blue as his magic, save for the arm that had covered the rat's mouth.</p><p>“Yes,” Lemres replied, “Thanks to you,” he bowed.</p><p>“Sure. You should be more careful.”</p><p>“I-I know now, I'm sorry, I haven't been out here before,” he still felt so nervous, he couldn't seem to stop talking now.</p><p>Outside, the noise began to grow. Much smaller birds, crickets, and cicadas chirping. But also a familiar set of squeaking.</p><p>The butlers must have heard the commotion. Lemres sighed again. He thought briefly about staying there, but he decided he had had enough adventure for one day.</p><p>“I should go now, they're looking for me.” He started out of the hole. “Thank you again. I'll repay you someday.” Then he stepped out, letting the butlers see him.</p><img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" style="width:756px" class="responsive"/><p>Sig supposed that would have been the end of it. He watched for a second as the little rat left with the others. He knew he wasn't from around here, but not how far. He understood wanting to travel, as a wanderer himself. He also understood how dangerous it was in this area, and didn't want to see someone so confused get hurt. Helping had felt good.</p><p>That was where his thoughts about rat ended for now. Until one afternoon. A chilly fall day, with leaves flying through the air. Sig wished some scale insects were flying instead, but leaves would have to do for now...</p><p>He had walked a ways from his garden, finding himself at a large tree. Plenty of leaves to eat under there, and he found a pile of them just off to the side. He crawled over and began to eat when suddenly several of them ended up in his face. They spread all over the ground. He was shocked but didn't move much, simply closing his eyes. When he opened them, he found himself face-to-face with something familiar.</p><p>“Oh, it's you!”</p><p>Ah, the small rat from a few days ago. he must have jumped into the pile of leaves. Mammals like to do that sometimes.</p><p>“It's you,” he echoed.</p><p>“I didn't expect to see any beetles here. Do you like to travel, too?”</p><p>“Yeah. looking for food.”</p><p>“Speaking of food, I have something for you.” From somewhere, the rat pulled out a small brown thing. “It's a chocolate I made! As thanks for rescuing me the other day.”</p><p>A chocolate? He had eaten some before out of curiosity, but it had long since melted. This one looked firm and fresh. “Thank you... uh, he said, trailing off.</p><p>” I'm sorry, I never introduced myself. My name is Lemres,“ the rat said with a bow.</p><p>” Sig,“ he replied, then went to chew the chocolate. His mandibles tore it open, revealing more creamy chocolate within. He put it in his mouth, enjoying the smooth, sweet taste.Soon it was all in there, and he groaned at the melty texture. This candy was so nice...</p><p>” Yum,“ he said once he finished. The young rat, Lemres, smiled.</p><p>” You're welcome!“ he seemed so proud of himself. It made Sig want to smile too. ”I love baking for others. Well, when I get the chance.“</p><p>” You're good at it.“</p><p>” Aw, you're too kind.“ the rat blushes.</p><p>They just stood there for a moment after that. A nice quiet moment under a tree, which Sig didn't mind at all. Eventually, they had to split, as it was getting dark.</p><p>” Could I see you again? You seem like an interesting fellow,“ Lemres said.</p><p>”Really? I'm not.“</p><p>” I don't think that's true. I've never seen a beetle use magic before. I'm a mage too. Maybe we can practice together,“</p><p>” Sure,“ Sig looked at the tree, ”here is ok.“</p><p>” Great! See you!“ he said, then ran off.</p><p>Sig watched him leave again. Watching him was interesting. Lemres seemed so full of energy. He wondered if it might get tiring, eventually. Once he left his sight, he started off himself, wondering about the rat's own magic.</p>
