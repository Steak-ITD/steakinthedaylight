                    <h3>PART 1 OF 2</h3>
                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Non explicit M/F sex, assault</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> So. This started as an idea brought about by the fact that there aren;t many noncon stories involving 1. Sonic doing so to Amy or 2. a teenager taking advantage of another without malice, but still clearly being irresponsible. That's what I wanted to write, and this is from the perspective of Amy recieving such treatment, and her internal feelings and growing fear at a situation she has misread. it took a lot out of me to actually get this down, mainly cause the subject wouldn't leave my head for a while until I actually began to write it, and it went through many drafts to get the proper words. I hope it came out ok.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Amy couldn't believe what she was seeing, what she was feeling.</p><p>On a bright sunny day, in the middle of the flower fields of Spring Valley Zone, Sonic had leaned in and kissed her.</p><p>Her idol, hero, crush... he was really kissing her!</p><p>Her chest fluttered, and she felt light, like the petals floating in the air. When he pulled back it took her a minute to come back to earth. Still a bit shocked by the sensation, she had to confirm. “You actually kissed me!”</p><p>Sonic rubbed the back of his head, glancing at the ground. ”Uhm, yeah, I... I couldn't resist anymore, I guess?“</p><p>Amy looked into his eyes. ”Does this mean you like me?“</p><p>Sonic looked back up, meeting her gaze. His eyes seemed to be full of longing. ”I suppose I do in a way.” he mused softly. He leaned towards her again. Excited, she moved to him, and their lips touched. He leans in more, holding onto her, kissing her deeper than before. She moans faintly feeling his tongue against her own. She was unaccustomed to it, but managed to catch on quickly, and imitated his movements. She almost became lost in the kiss, before noticing his hand was moving along her body, underneath her shirt.</p><p>Amy draws back from the kiss, looking down at Sonic's hand. “What are you doing?” she asks.</p><p>He opened his eyes. “Oh... I guess I got carried away,” he said, moving his hand away, albeit hesitantly. “I was really getting into the kiss, and I wanted to feel more of you.“ he paused. Looking back upwards, he breathed out. ”... See more of you.“</p><p>Amy's tummy fluttered again at his glances. But what he was asking... she couldn't quite describe how it made her feel. She was flattered, but there was a sense of nervousness. And a bit of excitement, too. She giggles a bit to calm herself down. Finally, she says, ”Ok! I think I get it.“</p><p>She begins removing her top, the butterflies in her stomach becoming fiercer, knowing Sonic's eyes are still on her. But there was no reason to be anxious. Still, she couldn't help but blush once she took it off and lay it to the side.</p><p>Briefly she looked back at Sonic, who was looking back at her, all around her, very intently. Her blush deepened, and she asked softly, ”H-how do I look?“</p><p>After a second, Sonic moves back in closer to Amy. ”Lovely,” he whispers, pressing his lips against hers again. As they continue to kiss, he lies her on the ground, leaning above her. His hands move on her hips again, this time downwards toward her skirt. She lets him this time.</p><p>When he pulls it off of her, she giggles again to calm her nerves, though it comes out shaky as their kiss breaks. Her blush returns while he takes a moment to look over her now bare body. It made her feel warm in a way different from the springtime sun. He leans in on top of her, head against her chest, then softly kisses the area. Moving back up just a bit, he says, “You're so pretty, Amy.” </p><p>The warmth in her chest spread throughout her whole being. Her breath steadily increased as his hands moved all over her body. It nearly overwhelmed her. They were so close to each other, and he had such a grip on her. Her emotions were so tangled; delight, anxiety, bewilderment, and something more...</p><p>She suddenly squeaked; a shock moved through her. Snapping out of her trance, she looked to where it started.</p><p>One of Sonic's hands was quite low down her body. His fingers hovered over her... sensitive area...? Before she could react further, he pushed and rubbed a certain spot, and she shook again. She gasped at his continued touching, the heat in her body increasing more and more.</p><p>“Feels good right?” Sonic said. Amy almost doesn't hear him. </p><p>” I-it's weird,“ she replies shakily.</p><p>Sonic smiled at her and chuckled. ” Don't worry, it'll feel better soon.“</p><p>His hand moved lower still. That place became warmer still, even more than the rest of her body. Once he... pushes a finger <em>inside</em>... she squeaks and closes her eyes. Whatever he was doing was making her lose her mind; she kept squeaking and moaning, and her leg twitched. his fingers kept moving inside and out, making the area wetter and wetter. he kept moving faster and faster.</p><p>Faster.</p><p>She realized how fast things were moving now. She couldn't tell anymore how long it had been since they were just kissing each other, she couldn't think straight anymore. It felt like so long ago now. </p><p>The petals in the air cut the blue of the sky. Moving as fast as the mind, flying off to who knows where.</p><p>...?</p><p>Something larger was pressed against her now. (When did his fingers move away?) She looked down below, (when did she open her eyes again?) and saw his... <em>length</em> so close to her now, pushing.</p><p>She blanched, struggling to find words. ”Uh-uhm! I, are you-“</p><p>” Amy,” Sonic spoke suddenly, “do you like me too?”</p><p>She stopped, shocked by the question. Why was he asking that now? Of course she did, that's what this had all been about, right? “Yes.” There was no reason for her to sound so unsure, and yet that's how her voice came out. It was the truth. She shouldn't feel nervous. There was no reason to feel nervous.</p><p>He looked her right in the eyes. “This is what people who like each other do together.” he spoke softly. his eyes had that same longing as before, but it was different this time. It covered them like a haze. She fidgeted, now realizing just how tightly Sonic had her thighs in his grip, keeping her legs open. Letting him push into her more.</p><p>“But what if I...” the words died in her throat. She was unsure what if, exactly. Unsure how she felt now, how she should feel now. Unsure if this was what she had...</p><p>“Trust me, ok?” he said, leaning in closer to her face. Their lips touched yet again, and he finally breached her. He eats up her high moan, deepening the kiss, and his depth inside her.</p><p>When he reaches an end, he pulls away, giving her the chance to take in the sensation.So filling, tight, hot, wet. Painful, and <em>nice</em>. He started to move back and forth, like with his fingers.Her whole body reacts, every movement elicits a moan from her. She felt like she was in an oven. The heat, inside her body and out, was so dizzying. The rest of the world seems to fade away in the moment, pink and blue blend together, petals becoming smaller and smaller as they mix with the sky above.</p><p>She knows she must be enjoying this. She knows she should be enjoying this too. Maybe she was after all. She had to. That's... this is what she wanted. It had to be. To be closer to him and feel these things. these confusing, painful, scary things. It must be right, it had to be.</p><p> Pressure began to grow in her lower half, snapping her out of her stupor. She began to panic as it grew tighter, while he kept moving faster, rougher. Struggling to find her voice again, she tried to tell him, “Wait, wait, something f-feels weird...!”</p><p> It took a bit for Sonic to hear her. “Huh? What's wrong?” he breathed, still moving.</p><p>“I feel weird, something... squeezing...”</p><p>He seemed to know what it was. “Oh! That's- it's ok! Just relax, let it happen,” he stammers. He held her back and lifted her up onto his lap. He was still in her, the motion still stimulating her body. The pressure coils and releases. She can't tell if she's still, or moving. Everything around her gets brighter and she grabs onto something, trying to hold onto... just trying to hold on.</p><p>It takes some time before it stops, and she feels like herself again.</p><p>“What happened?” Amy sobs.</p><p>“It's ok,” he said again (right?), “That's a normal reaction to this.”</p><p>She stared, trying to comprehend. That was a normal thing. That's good, isn't it? What she wanted all along. It didn't <em>feel</em> right, though. What happened didn't feel right to her. It made her feel so tired, too tired again to think.</p><p>She is still in his arms. Arms that were <s>supposed to be</s> trusted, caring arms. Arms that loved her and wanted her and held her down and up. She leaned into them, falling in deeper, with nowhere else to go.</p><p>More time probably passed. The wind began to chill, and more pollen from the trees blew off. Amy feels something wet again, but she hardly reacts. She feels like she should curl up when Sonic <s>finally</s> lets her go, to keep the last bit of fleeting warmth. but her body doesn't move. Her eyes stay on the ground, staring at the fallen petals and empty flowers they had accidentally crushed.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Sounds didn;t register to her for a few second.</p><p>“I said, are you ok?”</p><p>“Yes,” she murmurs, not looking up. Not looking at anything else. The two sat in silence for several more minutes, letting the setting sun darken the area.</p><img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" style="width:756px" /><p>Amy lay in her bed, staring at the ceiling. She had been doing that a lot lately, just staring. She couldn't help it. The rest of the world felt so distant since that day.</p><p>When they...</p><p>Why is it so hard to say, to think of for her? She should be happy! they were in love, doing that had made it clear. Right? It was a good thing. What she had dreamed of.</p><p>His looks. His touch. The way he spoke. It was... so confusing. All of it was so confusing. And so scary. She was scared. Why? Was she scared then? Didn't he see that? Didn't he know? He had reassured her that it was fine. </p><p>Despite her fear, it was fine.</p><p>Despite her rising breath, it was fine.</p><p>Despite her tears, it was fine.</p><p>Despite that heat she felt all over, it was fine.</p><p>Despite the tight ball she's hugging herself into, trying not to sob again, it was fine.</p><p>It's fine, it's all fine. It is.</p>
                    
                    <hr>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> I do eventually want to write it again from Sonic;s perspective, but I typed this during drug withdrawal. I'm tired.<br> I also imagine Amy feels orgasms more intensely than most, so it frightens her so much and is not as normal as Sonic thinks it is.</p>
