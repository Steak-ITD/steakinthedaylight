                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Rape/Non Con, Same Size Fatal Oral Vore, Obbsessive Behavior, generally depressing</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> I wrote this in a depressive episode almost a year ago now, all in one go. It's kind of a blur now. So this story is a bit more personal to me than the others. I explain why I made it below.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Beta woke up slowly, blinking his eyes, trying to adjust to the light. Or lack thereof.</p>
<p>When he looked around, he made out a couple of grey, metallic walls, with a few windows, and a skylight at the top, moonlight shining through it. Still, being high up, it barely lit the large room. He was up against a metal wall, with the other walls looking to be relatively far off. On the farthest wall was a staircase, leading downwards. The next thing he noticed was the temperature: it was remarkably cold in here. Although it didn’t seem like there was a draft. He briefly glanced down at himself, realizing he had no clothes on.</p>
<p>He tried to move around a bit, only to feel… stiff, locked in place. He looked down closely and found that his legs were tied together at the ankles. Instinctively, he moved his hands toward them, realizing they too were tied together by his wrists, behind his back. He furrowed his brow. He wouldn’t be able to move all the way to those stairs. How did he even get here? The last thing he remembered was being in his bed, asleep, with clothing on. Considering the view outside, he couldn’t have been asleep that long before somehow getting here.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard a noise. It was far off at first, but… getting closer. The noise was coming from the stairs. Was someone coming? His captor, most likely. But maybe someone to rescue him? Soon he saw someone coming up the stairs. It was too dark over there to make out who it was. But as they kept walking closer to him, into the moonlight, he recognized a familiar shade of green scales, and glowing white eyes staring into his.</p>
<p>He stared back, stunned. “Pico?”</p>
<p>Pico simpered, hearing his name come from that voice. “Beta…” he whispered.</p>
<p>Beta tilted his head; He wasn’t sure if he should feel relieved or not. At least this was someone he knew, but did that make it better or worse? “Uh… did you do this?”</p>
<p>Pico chuckled lightly. “Yeah, I did,” he said, still quiet, as he continued walking closer to Beta. “And it wasn’t easy. Finding your home… finding a place like this, abandoned and far enough away, getting you here while keeping you unconscious…” He bent down onto his knees once he got close enough. His smile had grown wider by now, his gaze never leaving Beta’s, making him grow more and more nervous.</p>
<p>He brought his hands to Beta’s sides. His touch was chilled, making Beta shiver. “But it will all be worth it soon,” he whispered again. He moved his hands down, towards Beta’s hips. “Just to be close to you again.”</p>
<p>Beta kept wincing at this sudden touch. Pico was still staring into his eyes as he moved down lower and lower. He’d just been told by his ex-boyfriend that he’d been kidnapped, possibly stalked, and now he was touching his naked body like they were still lovers. This was all happening too fast, too suddenly. He laughed a bit, trying to calm his nerves. “This is… this is some kind of… joke, isn’t it?” he sputtered.</p>
<p>Pico didn’t respond. He still stared, his eyes becoming half-lidded. Finally, his gaze into Beta’s eyes broke, as he looked down towards where he had been moving. His face was now inches away from the azure boy’s half-hard cock.</p>
<p>Beta was relieved he wasn’t being looked directly in the eyes anymore, but all that relief disappeared when he realized where that gaze had moved. He tried moving away, but he couldn’t get far with his restraints, and he was being held now as well. He opted to push his legs together instead, but they were easily pulled apart again. His heart raced as his panic increased.</p>
<p>Pico’s mouth opened slightly; his long, forked tongue slid out just a bit. He flicked it over the head. A tip of his tongue passed over the small opening, causing Beta to gasp. Then he let the head rest on his tongue as he moved a hand to stroke the length. Precum began dripping down the head, which Pico lapped up enthusiastically.</p>
<p>All the while, Beta was shaking above him, gritting his teeth, still trying to move away, trying hard not to feel anything from this. But his body wouldn’t listen to him. Each movement on his dick sent shivers up his spine. He struggled to think straight. Just as he managed to get out a shuddering “N-no, don’t…”, the motions seemed to stop. Pico had stopped stroking and moved his tongue away. Could it be that he’d actually listened? Realized how crazy this was?</p>
<p>The green dinosaur just licked his lips and gulped. “I missed tasting you like this,” he sighed and opened his mouth wider than before. He quickly put it over the other’s cock, all the way to the base. Beta moaned loudly, almost screaming at the sensation. His mouth was so warm, compared to the air around him. His tongue was wrapped around his cock, and his pointed teeth grazed it as he moved back and forth. All of these different feelings overwhelmed him, it felt so amazing, so… familiar…</p>
<p>No… no, he shouldn’t be enjoying this at all. He didn’t want this. He was being held here against his will, by his ex, and by his own body in a way. Still, he had to protest, to stop this somehow. “Please… stop… I can’t- “he choked out through his moans. He tried to kick him off, but he was still being held tight, and it did little to deter Pico. It only egged him on, as he moaned around Beta’s cock.</p>
<p>Eventually Beta came into Pico’s mouth. He swallowed it all in a few loud gulps, and slowly moved his head from the flaccid cock, his tongue lagging behind the rest of his mouth. He moved upwards and gazed again at Beta’s flushed face. He was panting, still shaking from the stimulation, and his face contorted in shame.</p>
<p>“Did you get what you wanted?” Beta mumbled. “Can I go now, please?”</p>
<p>Pico stared at him, right in the eyes. He moved particularly close to his face, smiling at him lovingly as though nothing was wrong. “Never.”</p>
<p>That word sent another shiver down Beta’s spine, causing his breath to hitch. He cringed when Pico stuck out his tongue again and licked his face, speaking to him in a soft, sickeningly sweet tone. “It’s been so long since we’ve seen each other. I felt… forlorn, lost without you. I don’t want to feel like that again.” He was still staring into his eyes, but something was different about his gaze now. It seemed more… hungry than before. “I don’t want you to leave me ever again…”</p>
<p>Panic began to rise in Beta when he saw Pico’s mouth opening wider. He wasn’t really going to… was he? He tried to back away as far as possible, but he was still restrained against the wall. Nowhere else to go but down… soon, his head was engulfed in the dark maw. A strong swallow brought him into his gullet.</p>
<p>Beta felt the restraints on his wrists being untied. As soon as they were free, he tried to move his hands somewhere, anywhere, but he couldn’t see anything. And he was being pushed deeper into Pico’s throat, losing the ability to move his arms around. Eventually the same happened with his ankles, but he didn’t attempt moving them around much. Was there really anything he could do at this point? He just let himself get swallowed all the way down and sobbed a bit when he could no longer feel the cool air of the outside world.</p>
<p>He landed headfirst in the damp stomach. He could barely see a thing in there, and it was far too hot and stuffy. He could hardly move around, the space was so tight, he might as well still be tied up. There was a small amount of liquid pooled at the bottom. The acid… He felt something from outside stroking his head.</p>
<p>Pico was rubbing his large belly, sighing blissfully. He felt more complete than he had before now that his love was so close to him. They would be even closer before long. It was a shame he wouldn’t get to hear his lovely voice anymore, but it was a small price to pay, to never have to part with him again.</p>
<p>Beta was feeling far from blissful. He didn’t have it in him to protest or struggle anymore. He couldn’t believe everything that had happened so quickly. He still had a small amount of hope that this was a twisted dream. It couldn’t be real, it couldn’t…</p>
<p>It was getting damper in there. More acid was coming from the stomach walls, pooling at the bottom. Beta was starting to feel a tingling sensation in the liquid. He began sobbing again as it rose towards his chest. He felt rubbing close to his head again and vaguely made out a voice from outside. </p>
<p>“Don’t worry…it’ll be over soon…” </p>
<p>Was that supposed to be comforting? It only made him more despondent. The acids had risen to his head now. He whimpered again. The sting was only getting worse now… he realized wistfully there was no way out of this.</p>
<p>He only hoped now that it really would be over soon.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> This is the darkest story I've written, for now. I made this sometime during my senior year of college, which was pretty stressful for several reasons. There was a large sense of worry, hopelessness. Was I really going to pass college? What would happen after? I have no idea what to do for my senior project, I'm going to fail, be miserable, etc. I think this story is a culmination of that. It's confusing, it's sad. I was confused and sad. <br> Now obviously my actual situation is nothing like what happened in this twisted story. That's fiction for you. It is not <b>directly</b> related to real life, but <b>abstractly</b> related. Sometimes it can be an amount of wishfulness, which begs the question of why I'd have it end so... miserably. I suppose I could try to explain my interest in darker kinks like rape and gore and death... I think there's something attractive about pain to me... the physical and emotional. Not only that but it is very cathartic in a way, it feels like a release of pent up somethings. And writing/drawing these things is obviously much safer than, like, actually hurting myself. Having it end badly gives me a sense of finality, like, it's over, the pain is now done. You went through it and now you can feel null. Happy endings also have a similar, but distinct feeling, that I would describe more like relief than finality.<br> Now I'm still trying to figure myself out so I can't explain why or when I feel like having either feeling, but at this particular point in my life I wanted to feel the finality, and so this story came out of me, very fast, faster than i've ever written anything. I edited it a bit to be more relevant to my interests and to generally be more readable, but it's mostly intact as it was when I typed this into Word in a blur. <br> Oh, the character choice? I... I like yandere lizards...</p>
