                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Roughness resulting in pain... I'm not sure how to word it.</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> This was originally going to be a part of the Stress Relief series I made during college, but I ended up not finishing it for a long while, mainly because I could only get it just under 100 words (90). During the months I didn't work on it, I came up with a longer plotline for it, so this will be the first chapter of 3. Unlike Creepy Clown Car I actually have this planned out, so i should be able to finish it for real this time! It was originally going to be an Accidental Snuff piece but now it'll be a bit more complex.</p>

                    <p>Girlfriend often forgot her own strength. She didn't remember how fragile humans could be. It didn't cross her mind in the throes of passion, embracing her lover with newfound vigor...</p>

<p>Only after she fell from her high did she register the smell of iron. The red that covered her hands. Putting her hands back down, to her partner, whose breaths were short and light.</p>

<p>How long had he been still? Why hadn't she noticed? The last few minutes were such a blur. She found herself as motionless as he was.</p>
