                    <h3>PART 2 OF 3</h3>
                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> explicit m/f sex</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Here it is, part 2. It's very sweet and peaceful, unlike part 3.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Amy put her cold, wet clothes on the table in the room and brought over the medical supplies to the bed where Bark was sitting.  He reached over to grab some but she stopped him. "Here, let me." She put something on a rag and rubbed it on his wounds. He winced at the sting but quickly relaxed again. Then Amy did the same for herself. Bark noticed she was still shivering a little, so he brought her closer to him. She was a bit surprised at first but she slowly leaned into his warm fur.</p>

                    <p>"Thank you." Amy said as she pulled out bandages and wraps. "For helping me. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there." She sighs and begins applying them to his cleaned wounds. "I am going to be stronger next time. So you won't have to hurt yourself saving me."</p>
                    
                    <p>Bark hums while she finished wrapping his injuries, and watches her do her own. She had on a somber face. He decided to give her head a soft rub. She sighed again at the touch, this time more peaceful. Her hand move up to touch his. The two of them were so close. It made Amy's heart race, as if she were still in danger. But she knew they were safe now. Together. She flushed. He really was such a sweet guy...</p>
                    
                    <p>"Hey, do you think I could... try something?" she mumbled. Bark looks at her quizzically, and watches her move her hand on his chest. It was still so warm, and moved with his breath. Her hands slowly move down to his belly, and then between his thighs. He twitches at the touch. His hands move towards hers, moving down with them. He nods slowly. Together their hands go lower to his crotch. </p>
                    
                    <p>Amy rubs the sheath and watches as his penis emerges. When it comes out enough, she moves a hand to touch it, looking up at Bark's reaction. He had his eyes closed and nouth slightly agape. He exhaled sharply when she puts her other hand on his length and starts stroking softly. She could feel it throbbing. She moves one hand down to the base, the other going towards the tip. She rubbed it with her thumb while lightly squeezing the base.</p>
                    
                    <p>Bark moans, and a drop of pre cum dribbles down. Amy blushes, seeing someone get like this because of her. She licks where the pre had run down. Then, moving both her hands to the base, she eagerly puts her mouth around the head. Looking back up at Bark, she sucks it in, more pre cum dripping out into her mouth. Bark moans louder, and places his hand on the back of Amy's head, slightly pushing her down more. She looks up once again in delight; seeing him so aroused got her excited too. She pushes a little deeoer, feeling his length enter her throat. It caused her to gag a little, making Bark let go of her head. </p>
                    
                    <p>She realized his cock could fill up her whole throat. So she began to bob her head up and down instead, gradually swallowing more and more of the length each time. In the meantime, her hands remained at the base, rubbing in short strokes and occasionally squeezing at it. Bark's breaths became faster and heavier. He tried to keep control of himself and not thrust into her warm, eager mouth, in fear of hurting her. Amy keeps going back and forth, and Bark gasps at the motion. His cock twitches in her throat and strings of cum shoot down into her stomach. She lets out a light whine as her throat filled with the hot liquid. Once it stops, she slides his cock out of her mouth with a light pop. The two breath in tired unison for a few minutes before Amy giggles softly.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Sorry. I've never deepthroated anyone before," she said between laughs. "It feels so weird!"</p>
                    
                    <p>Still with heavy breaths, Bark smiles weakly at her. They lay naked together, both feeling much warmer than before, even without the covers of the bed. Amy reaches out and touches Bark's chest gently, running her fingers along his fur. In turn, he runs his fingers through the quills on her back. Then he gently lifts her on top of him, closer to his face. They lean in to kiss each other. The taste of his semen remains in her mouth, and he licks it up. Once they break the kiss, Bark leans up, still holding Amy in his arms. Then he lays her back on the bed.</p>
                    
                    <p>He leans over on top of her. Amy felt her heart racing excitedly again. She looked into his eyes, seeing a great hungering for her. His face presses on her belly, and he sniffs her quite loudly, making her giggle again. Thrn when he reaches the wet slit below, he takes an extra long whiff. He opens his mouth, his tongue lolling out. Amy nods enthusiastically after he looks back up at her. Gripping her legs, he takes a long lick in between her folds. She cries out softly at the feeling of a rough tobgue stimulating her sensituve flesh. She wanted it so, so bad. She moans as she spreads apart her thighs and arches her back. Eagerly, Bark latches his mouth onto her clit and alternates between short flicks of his tongue and longer forceful lashes. The pleasure drives her insane.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Ah! Ah, Bark!" Amy cries out her lover's name in between gasps and moans. Sensing her climax, he digs his tongue deep within her inner walls, lapping up all the juice inside. She grips the sheets tightly and simultaneously screams and squeaks as her orgasm washes over her. Bark continues licking, even as her cum splashes on his face. Once she comes down from the high, he moves back up as well, licking the liquid on his face. He lifts her into his arms again, his finger wiping away the small tears on her eyes.</p>
                    
                    <p>As he kisses her again and again, Amy realizes she has never felt anything like this before... not even Sonic had the same effect this bear did on her. She cared for him very dearly, and could now tell he felt the same way about her. She always knew he was a gentle and careful guy, despite his work. But she didn't expect to fall in love with him...</p><hr />
                    
                    <p>The two lay side by side, watching the raging storm outside from the safety and comfort of their shared bed. They now lay under the covers snuggled up together. Amy looked up at Bark's peaceful face and sighed happily. Still, there was something on her mind...</p>
                    
                    <p>"Bark? Do you... do you have any place to stay?" she said. He cocked his head in confusion. She looks down as she continues, "If you don't, I have some room in my house. So you don't have to keep paying for these inns every night." She looks back up, seeing his eyes wide in shock. "...you know, I mean, I'm just saying. I'm a bit worried about your safety staying at those places..." She trails off, embarrassed. Bark closes his eyes and exhales, calming his nerves. Amy noticed that his tail wagged back and forth a bit.</p>
                    
                    <p>"...Amy..." Bark murmurs. Amy turns her head towards him. His voice... it was deep, yet tender. It fit him perfectly. He turned his head away from her, his face all red. She held his hand in response, and he turned his eyes back to her.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Please? It's the least I can do after all you've done for me. And..." her grip tightened, "I'd also like to see you more often." She smiled shyly, resisting the urge to turn away herself. Bark looks at her again. His heart ached at how adorable she was right now. Her cheeks were bright red and her lips were trembling slightly; she seemed nervous. But there's something else; there's something hidden behind those soft eyes of hers. </p>
                    
                    <p>He finally nods in agreement. Amy hugged his neck in return. "Great! And again, thank you. For everything."</p>
                    
                    <p>Soon after, the two of them doze off in each other's arms. Bark feels warm, safe, and contented; everything seemed like it would be alright for the foreseeable future. As sleep overtakes him, his last thought is of Amy. She feels warm in his arms as well.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> And so comes the end of this rewrite. I think it came out really well, please let me know if you enjoyed it.</p>
