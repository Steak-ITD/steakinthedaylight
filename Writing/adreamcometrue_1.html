                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Obbsessively unhealthy relationship, bloodletting and blood drinking</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> THIS TOOK TOO LONG TO FINISH. Said every fanfic writer ever, I know. but I literally was just sitting on it for a year. It's actually about 3/4 done already! Anyway, what is this? I saw a prompt on a tumblr blog a long time ago now, and made a Pokemon story based on it. I will share the prompt later, as doing so now will spoil the story. It was delightfully obbsessive though! I wanted to capture that kind of two sided unhealthy relationship in this story, and I think I did so pretty well so far. Tell me if you think so.</p>

                    <p>When Jabez and Hashim met, it changed both their lives forever. At least, that's how it felt for the two of them.</p>
<p>Their feelings for each other were obsessive, almost unhealthily so. They would soon spend every moment with each other, learning every detail, every inch of each other. It was impossible to see them not by each other's sides, and soon, it became rarer to see them at all. They would hide, just to have moments to themselves, more and more often.</p>
<p>Jabez loved Hashim. Before they had met, he hadn't been very happy in life. Trust had been hard to come by, and it seemed like anyone he was close to had let him down, in one way or another.
Slowly, he lost his hope for life. But with Hashim, it was different. He felt like he could trust him with his life, his body, his soul. He knew that no matter what, he would always be there for him.</p>
<p>Hashim loved Jabez. Before they had met, he felt his life had a gaping hole. As though he was missing something. He was miserable before, going about his day with this empty feeling. Once Jabez came into his life, it all changed. This incredible, ethereal being, like a beacon of light in his
dark, dreary existence. Finally, he felt complete. And he was so grateful to him.</p>
<p>After only a few months, a few blissful months, Hashim decided he had to show Jabez what he meant to him. He had a special plan for his love. It would be beyond comparison, right out of a prophetic dream.</p>
<p>One sunny day, Hashim brought Jabez to a not-too-far-off temple, on a small island off the coast of their hometown. The temple was old and abandoned, likely not used in hundreds of years. It was quite empty too, save for a large fountain in the middle. It had a star at the top, and the basin was also decorated with indentations of stars. It too had fallen into disrepair. </p>
<p>Fixing this was no issue for Hashim. He had easily figured out how it had functioned and after cleaning off all of the grime, it worked like new. He didn't know what this fountain, or the temple, had been used for long ago Nobody at home did. But today, it was going to have a brand new purpose. A better purpose, surely.</p>
<p>"Hashim, This is beautiful," Jabez said, staring in awe at the shining fountain before him. "You fixed it? This whole place, just for me?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I knew it would be a perfect place of worship for you." Hashim walked up to Jabez and hugged him tightly, lifting the smaller monster up closer to him.</p>
<p>Worship. That word Jabez blush. Once he got close enough to Hashim's face, he quickly pushed his lips onto his, which was returned in kind. The two kept holding each other close, kissing,
feeling each other's body against the other.</p>
<p>After what felt like far too short a time, Hashim moved just slightly away and lifted Jabez up. "It's time to sit upon your throne," he coos as his psychic power surrounds Jabez, bringing him up to the top of the fountain, along with some twine. He stared at Hashim the whole time as he tied him to the top. Staring into his beautiful eyes. </p>
<p>He giggled as he saw him telekinetically lift up a stained knife, the same one they had played with in private with reckless abandon. So many times they had spilled blood, becoming one with each other. Now, the knife floated up to his throat. It pressed in place until the skin broke, and slowly slide across. Jabez moaned; Hashim always knew exactly what he liked, even if it took him some time to see it himself. He didn't care about the pain or the light-headedness he felt as he watch his blood pour down his body and into the water below. It became a pretty shade of pink and yellow.</p>
<p>Once done with his work, Hashim too stared at the fountain's now mixed water. He stepped foward and, looking at Jabez again, cupped some into his hands and took a sip. "Delicious," he whispered. "Rich and filling." As it should be from such an immaculate figure, it was irresistible. </p>
<p>That was how the two stayed for several minutes, Jabez watching as Hashim filled himself with his life, adoring all the work and love and care he had put into his gift. But it wasn't the end of it. No, this gift would become much more special and involved. </p>
<p>Hashim wouldn't be the only one made to worship his god.</p>
