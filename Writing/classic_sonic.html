                    <p>Unlike most people, it's not mainly the gameplay (though I enjoy it). I think it's the... aesthetic, presentation, simple complexity... In classic games, they can tell their stories almost wordlessly. Other than the manuals, which I also think, at least in Japanese, explained their worlds and characters in an eloquent way. It gets me invested even if it's not super elaborate or detailed. But what they do in detail really implies things, makes you imagine. Starting with Sonic 2, when things got more detailed, it made you wonder about the history behind each place. The flowers of Emerald Hill, the heat, and water of Chemical Plant, the games and grandeur of Casino Night, the height and volcano of Hill Top, the mysteries of Mystic Cave (and Hidden Palace by extension), the factories and poor air of Oil Ocean, the structures and livability of Metropolis... so on and so forth. These places don't really have stories as far as I know, but the way they look, how they're designed and distinct from each other, really makes you wonder. You can see a world here, even without the details. This got better in CD and 3&amp;K.</p>

<p>CD especially I think told its story wonderfully through visuals and music. Each place there feels like it has a purpose, and that people live there. And that makes you feel more like there's something to lose (and there is). So it makes me feel more invested in that game, despite its... level design flaws. Well, they really did the aesthetic masterfully in that game. One thing I especially love is that the good futures aren't just nature prevailing over everything, it's nature and technology co-existing, even combining to make something truly beautiful. Particularly the final level, Metallic Madness, where it looks like a botany lab, and the city is bright and shining in the sunlight, it feels so much less claustrophobic.</p>

<p>3&amp;K also told its story visually, though a bit more cutscene oriented. It is still wordless (besides the manual). You can still figure out what the stakes are and how the characters feel. It's, uh, quaint. Not sure if I'm using that term right. But anyway, like the previous games, its level aesthetics give you a sense of wonder, it makes you imagine the history behind them, who inhabits these areas, and how they use them. That kind of ambiguity is really effective. It leads its way to headcanons and interpretations in a natural way that I think creators nowadays can't seem to get quite right.</p>

<p>The characters are like that too. They are not incredibly detailed, some barely having traits to describe them, but from their designs and mannerisms, you can wonder, you can imagine. Think about how they interact with each other and their world, even without a cutscene. The manuals also help with that of course! As they describe some traits of the characters and sometimes dialogue with each other. It's very charming.</p>

<p>Speaking of the characters, I kind of prefer their attitudes from this era as well... I enjoy Sonic being a chill and laid-back "do-what-you-like" kind of guy, who doesn't consider himself a hero but just does what he feels is right. I like Knuckles being gullible because he's pure and honest, short-tempered but meaning well, and takes his tasks seriously. I like Amy having more of a cute, fannish crush, and her having a sense of mysticism to her. I like Eggman being somewhat childish in his worldview but also genuinely dangerous and insane. And their simplicity paves the way for imagining other things about them. Tails, for example, is clearly very smart and competent but perhaps doesn't see it until meeting Sonic and helping him and becoming more confident in himself.</p>

<p>The whole thing just... it gives you a sense of wonder! Adventure! Imagination! It makes you feel good! I think that's fantastic! The classic universe just does that in a fun way to me. I'd also like to point out the 30th-anniversary IDW comic. It builds upon those feelings of wonderment with its set designs and has more character interactions to go with it. I love it. I personally consider it part of this universe and I'd love to see them have a go at it again. Maybe for 35th? So, that's why I get into the classic game universe more than anything.</p>

<p>The modern one? I like it too, but... it definitely lacks something. It's more elaborate, I guess. Cinematic even? I think it tries too hard in some areas, to be a more serious thing. And that doesn't always work. I think it worked fine with Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, but after Shadow the Hedgehog... eh, it doesn't clique with me much. And I'm on the side of Classic and Modern being separate universes [the one idea from Forces I can respect...]. These two eras just feel too different to me to be considered 1 timeline, one universe. I mean playing, like, Sonic CD and then playing Sonic Adventure right after is like WHIPLASH. You just can't convince me these are the same world! These are the (exact) same characters! Not to mention Modern's consistency issues... everyone else has talked that to death so I'm not gonna bother.</p>

<p>
  <small>side note but I vastly prefer the classic versions of the chaotix characters and I wish they'd be acknowledged like, ever</small>
