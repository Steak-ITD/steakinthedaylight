                    <hr>
                    <p>Boyfriend sat up on the bed. He closed his eyes. The pain of the marks on his back ebbed throughout his body, in time with his heartbeat. He took a deep breath, and sobbed as he exhaled. </p>

<p>Girlfriend panicked when she heard it. "Are you ok? Was I too rough?"</p>

<p>He opened his eyes again. He crawled up to her and swung his arms around her neck. Hoarse, he whispered, "I'm fine. You were wonderful."</p>

<p>In turn she gently wrapped her arms around his waist. How strange, he thought. The same person's touch can be so terrifying and so sweet.</p>
