                    <h3>PART 1 OF 3</h3>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> I decided to rewrite this story without any AI input, as I became a little unsatisfied with how it was worded originally. I hope this time it comes out a be more elegant. You can find the original at <a href="/Writing/AI Text/aurora_storm.html">this link</a>. This time, I'm writing it in order too.</p>

<p>Amy didn't like cold weather very much. She prefered warm sunny weather in a flower field. Even a desert would have been a bit better than the bitter chills of Aurora Icefield. Unfortunately, this was where the work was, so she had been told. She had only been here once before, but not for very longs, and she hadn't noticed how far apart things were. It took several minutes to get from one place to another. But she wouldn't let that, or the cold deter her! She was determined to earn her own money.</p><p>Her focus prevented her from hearing the footsteps behind her. She may not have seen anyone from afar either, as her follower blended in quite well with the snowy white surroundings. A blue-white bear had noticed this out of place traveler. So charming to him. He would be happy to “aquaint” himself with her after getting a bit closer.</p><p>He got close enough for Amy to hear his footsteps. She paused, suprised that someone else was around. She turned only to see nobody there. That was strange, she knew she heard something...?</p><p>“Good evening, young lady,” the bear said with a toothy smile. Amy turned back around to find the large sized bear staring at her. </p><p>“Oh! Sorry, I didn't see you there,” she stuttered. His face seemed very friendly, at least at first. But the longer she looked, the more strange it felt. And how had he not seen him? Or heard him move for so long? </p><p>The bear spoke again, ”You seem lost, don't you? Why don't I help you along?”</p><p>“No thanks, I know where I'm going from here, it's just far.” She didn't really want to be around him very long, his seemongly polite demeanor was freaking her out a little. She started walking past him, but was stopped by a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>“Are you sure? You are not from around here, are you?” he seemed a bit urgent.</p><p>But Amy was just as insistent “I'm fine, thanks” she tried pulling away from his hand, which was getting tighter. “I really should be going...!”</p><p>“I don't think so.“ He began to pull her closer. I have things I'd like to show you. You're coming with me now sweetie.”</p><p>The ground below Amy had given way to ice. The slippery ground made it harder for her to escape his grasp. “Get away from me!” she yelled out. Her quills began to flair. Fortunately the sharpness made the baer loosen his grip enough for her to get away. She pulled out her hammer. “I'm not going anywhere with you!”</p><p>The bear took an aggressive stance. “You're feisty. Good. That will make this much more fun.” He smiled again. He was going to enjoy showing her how strong he was.</p><p>The two lunged at each other. Amy swung her hammer furiously, hitting his head and shoulder. The bear's claw hit her arm, and he wasn't slowing down. He was pretty fast for a bear his size, and he moved around Amy, slashing at her other arm.</p><p>It made it harder to hold her hammer, but she kept going, aiming for his side. He growled in pain and turned. His fangs sunk into her cheek. Still in his mouth, he flung her body across and into the ice, cracking it just slightly. </p><p>”Persistent, aren't you? Too bad it's not enough.“ The cruel bear stomped on Amy's stomach, making her scream. ”Once again; you are coming with me.“ He lifted his foot again, aiming for her head.</p>

<p>Bark didn't mind cold weather at all. It made sense being a polar bear adapted to such weather, but he also found something peacful in the endless blank expanses of snow. The white contrasted the light of the sky wonderfully, even with the snowstorm starting to brew. Although, viewing this with a warm fire by his side sounded nice too. </p><p>That's what he planned to do tonight, heading to the nearest inn. However, the tranquility of the area was broken up by yelling. Loud, angry yelling. It was a bit confusing, as fights usually broke out closer to any establishments. Perhaps someone had fallen through the ice again? He decided to investigate further. The voices grew more clear as he got closer, and he realized there definitely was a fight going on. He moved past mounds of snow until he also heard growling and scratching. Then a piercing scream in a voice he recognized.</p><p>Amy Rose?</p><p>He skipped wondering what she was doing here and ran towards the noises, hearing her cry in pain again. He saw another polar bear above her, and without thinking charged into him. Both fell to the icy floor.</p><p>Expecting impact and feeling none, Amy looked to the side to see two bears on the ground. She saw a familiar, angry face staring at her would be captor. She was so glad, someone had heard, and it was Bark, someone she knew. </p><p>The other bear roared back at Bark. “You had better leave while you still can.“</p><p>He pushed Bark up, who then swung at his face. The other just barely dodged, but couldn't move away from the next swing to his gut.</p><p>Amy watched as the two bears continued their battle. She was still feeling dazed from the injuries she hit, but she knew she had to do something. Where was her hammer...</p><p>While Bark used his fists, the blue bear used claws, aiming for his face and stomach. Blood dripped down from Bark's mouth where he had been scratched. He bit back, and the two exchanged blows more. Then with a stronger punch, Bark pushed the larger bear back on the ground with a hard slam. He groaned as he couldn't get up right away, feeling sore from all the punches.</p><p>”I'm not giving this one up!” the bear growled, but before he could move again, Amy came up behind his head, and swung her hammer down on his head as hard as she could. The sound reverberated around the area. The bear stopped moving after that. </p><p>Amy and Bark breathed heavily. She looked up at him. His expression was unusually unreadable. She wanted to say something, but her mind wouldn't slow down enough. Before she could think of something, she was scooped up into Bark's arms, and he started moving again.</p><p>“Where are we going!?“ she asked nervously. Silent as usual, he didn't answer, but she could hear how labored his breathing was. She also noticed how the snow had begun to pick up. He was running while injured in this snow... keeping her close, keeping her safe. </p><p>Amy regretted being beaten so easily, and that she had to be rescued. She didn't want to think about what might have happened if he hadn't come in time. She thought she was stronger than this.</p><p>The two of them finally reached a building. A sign with the words, ”Campfire Inn“ stood outside the doorway. Bark slowed down, still keeping Amy in his arms.</p><p>The inn was very small, and had only a few other customers. The owner was a cheery old man, who greeted them with a smile before seeing their condition. ”Welcome to my establishment! Oh, it's you... goodness, what happened out there?“</p><p>Bark finally let go of Amy, resting her on her feet. She found she stumbled just a bit, and her arms and face were still sore, but it was more managable.</p><p>”Um, we were attacked earlier, my friend saved me.“ She looked down. ”I don't have any money.”</p><p>“Don't worry about that. Any friend of Bark's is welcome here. Please, make yourselves cofortable. Let me get some medical supplies. If you need anything else, please ask.” The old man smiled again and sgtarted leading them to a room.</p><p>Amy nodded and followed him to a room. It had a large bed and a table. He put the supplies on the table and left the two on their own.</p>
