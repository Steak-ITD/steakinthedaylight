Two days later, a separate directory was created to quarantine the rest of the "Terrywads" away from the regular archive. No tears were shed in the community — except, perhaps, by the WADs' creators and their fans.

On top of all this, the author loved to advertise this WAD, even when told by seemingly the whole <em>Doom</em> community to stop, earning him a reputation as an <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a>.</li><li> His other releases aren't much better. They're largely intentionally provocative concept WADs that could be considered "avant-garde" if one were charitable, from <em><strong>30,000 Levels</strong></em> (30,000 of the same box with an exit switch <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteEnvironments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteEnvironments">repeated over and over</a>), to <em><strong>Blind Doom</strong></em> and <em><strong>Seizure Doom</strong></em> (exactly what those imply, with the bonus that <em>Blind Doom</em> still has visible floor and ceiling textures), to <em><strong>The Worst Level Ever Made</strong></em> (also precisely that, a player is put in a simple box with height, width and length having the amount of 1 each and nothing else). These WADs and the aforementioned Terrywads ultimately led to the Worst Wad Cacoward being discontinued in 2011, as it was originally meant for <em>unintentionally</em> bad work and awarding it to WADs made bad <em>on purpose</em> attracted <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolls</a> and caused it to lose most of its meaning.</li></ul></li></ul></div></p><p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire Emblem&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> has an extensive hacking community, so a lot of stinkers turn up. One of the biggest problems is that most "total conversion" hacks tend to get abandoned before the halfway point; it's rare for most of these hacks to ever make it past the first few chapters before ending abruptly and leaving whatever story was being established <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware">up in the air</a>. Meanwhile, "balance" or "challenge" hacks are either laughably unbalanced or unfairly difficult, and may also be <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">buggy due to a lack of testing</a>. Some other extremely common issues for any type of hack are poorly designed maps with equally poor enemy placement, high level foes that the player must defeat long before it would be feasible for them to do so, unbalanced character stats and growths that either make the game too easy (no one has any poor stats at any point, resulting in an army of juggernauts) or too hard (none of the characters' stats go up reliably, resulting in a weak team well into high levels), terrible sprite work, and poor quality music.</p><p><ul><li> <em><strong>Tales of the Emblem</strong></em> is the epitome of lazy hacking. It simply replaces every major character in <em>The Sacred Stones</em> (Lyon being the odd exception) with <em>Tales</em> characters. It also horribly breaks every character, gives stat boosters more than one use and gives almost everyone terrible, terrible sprites with badly inserted blinking frames.</li><li> There's also <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemDifferentDimensionsOstianPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemDifferentDimensionsOstianPrincess">Fire Emblem: Different Dimensions: Ostian Princess</a></strong></em>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">FEDDOP</a>, which is what you will be after playing it. The design decisions make hardly any sense, the plot (which stars Lilina's <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter">right-out-of-nowhere daughter</a> Lilian) has so many holes that it might as well not exist, there's hardly any difficulty at all and after clearing chapter 13 <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnwinnable">the game goes right back to chapter 12, causing an infinite loop</a>. It's broken on a completely hilarious level. If you like, you may experience a Let's Play <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230729212310/http://lparchive.org/Fire-Emblem-Different-Dimensions-Ostian-Princess/">here.<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230729212310im_/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"/></a><ul><li> Much of the game is simply <em>Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</em> with a sloppy find-and-replace job done to its script. One one hand, much of the new dialogue is dedicated to trying to shoehorn the events of the original game into its new context, handwaving everything that doesn't make sense with bad jokes and fourth-wall breaks. For stuff that isn't changed, it is now either spoken by different characters that now act massively out-of-character (Legault and Oswin are now generic bandit bosses), or by new characters regardless of whether it now makes sense (Sain is replaced with a 10-year old boy named Axel, but much of Sain's flirtatious behaviour towards women receive no edits).</li><li> The actual gameplay is hilariously imbalanced. There are barely any promoted enemies by the time you've recruited several, every playable character comes with a ridiculous and nonsensical inventory by default, and most unit statlines are extremely inconsistent and often broken (Zach, a unit who's theoretically meant to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> thanks to his high Speed stat, somehow has no Constitution (not zero Constitution, <em>no number whatsoever</em>) meaning that he takes a massive penalty to his Speed stat with most weapons and needs to rely on his Strength to carry him). Natalie, a one-off unit from the original game that you had to defend in a <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionMission">Protection Mission</a>, replaces Merlinus as your Transporter. But because her 'game over on death' flag isn't changed, you are given a unit with terrible stats that cannot fight back, and will make you lose if she does die.</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>Corrupt Theocracy</strong></em> is another disastrous one. It claims to be a "semi-custom" hack, which means that the sprites are either splices/recolors of pre-existing sprites or are just the original sprites with no modification at all. It also means that many of the maps are just maps from FE7 itself, just with changed enemy placement and a ramped up difficulty. The maps that <em>are</em> new are universally poor, and often the only "challenge" in any of the maps is dealing with hordes of pathetically weak enemies, usually mixed in with a couple of obscenely powerful ones. The characters are horribly unbalanced, with many of them being so <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">overpowered</a> that the <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">weapon triangle</a> that defines <em>Fire Emblem</em> gameplay is completely irrelevant here. The story, while not as bad as <em>Ostian Princess</em>, is poorly written, rife with grammatical errors, and mostly told through tedious narration rather actually <em>showing</em> the player anything, and includes several incredibly clumsy attempts to tackle "adult" subject matter but end up just being uncomfortable to read. There are also a number of bugs, such as being unable to look at the stats of the lord of the first part of the game, certain weapons not displaying their stats properly, the screen going black at the start of certain chapters, and the inexplicable return of every single character from the first part of the game once the player gains access to the prep screen in the second part. Fortunately, the creator learned from their mistakes and would later go on to create both <em>The Sun God's Challenge</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSunGodsWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSunGodsWrath">Fire Emblem: The Sun God's Wrath</a></em>, the latter of which in particular is very well-regarded.</li><li> <em><strong>Duo Geno Escapo</strong></em> is often considered one of the worst Fire Emblem hacks of the FE Builder era. The graphics and sprites that were changed from the base game are either unconvincing splices of already existing sprites with clashing palettes added in, or recycled portraits from other FE games. The gameplay is horribly unbalanced (enemies tend to be tediously, overwhelmingly strong, rigging is needed to get past some sections, there are a lot of gameplay-related glitches and map design is generally uninspired and awful, with some maps being based off <em>Pok&eacute;mon routes</em> and using tilesets wrong), and the music ranges from merely okay to overly loud and earsplitting, with a rather good amount of tracks also being very quiet in contrast. But what pushes this hack over the edge is the writing, with humor that is just plain unfunny even when it doesn't contain tasteless, offensive jokes that only <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">cross the line once</a>. A nonsensical, hard-to-follow story, protagonists that are the very definition of <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Heroes</a>, and horrible, unintentionally funny quotes singlehandedly made a rather big part of the community turn against not just <em>Duo Geno</em>, but also against this kind of lower-effort humor-based hacks. While the creator is too willing to promote it to be ashamed of it, <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">he agrees with all the criticism the hack has gotten</a>, claiming its overall unpolished nature to be due to him making the hack with a friend over the course of two years while the two were still immature and new to hacking, and only thinking of releasing it when it was halfway completed. Still, you would think they would try to touch it up a bit before its release. The hack was removed from FE Universe in early 2020 due to a controversy that arose when a similarly offensive hack had its thread closed, but you can read an archive of the thread <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230729212310/https://web.archive.org/web/20181211221413/http://feuniverse.us/t/fe7-duo-geno-escapo/3198">here<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230729212310im_/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"/></a>, and a patch of the hack itself is still available in Romhacking.net.</li><li> Then there's the infamous <em><strong>Gheb FE</strong></em> and <em><strong>Gheb Saga</strong></em>, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMolester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMolester">Gheb</a> of FE8 as the protagonist. While they were technically competent compared to other hacks at the time they were made, they're both marred by unbalanced gameplay that seems designed less to challenge the player and more to simply <em>aggravate</em> them. Worse still, the "story" of both is less an actual narrative and more an excuse for extremely vulgar "humor", most frequently involving rape and pedophilia, but without any actual <em>jokes</em>, simply having characters say and do terrible things with very few attempts at actual comedy to make it even a little more palatable. Due to all this, both games (especially the first) developed an especially unpleasant reputation, and their own creator <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">regrets making them</a>.</li></ul></div></p><p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUGEN&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUGEN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUGEN">M.U.G.E.N</a></em> is a freeware fighting game engine that lets players design their own fighters. Some are good, or even great. Others... aren't. Some of the particularly bad ones are referred to as "Retarded Characters" in the community due to said characters having horrible controls, badly coded features, and deplorable spritework. In some cases, the spritework may be really good, but the characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment">blatant ripoffs of existing characters</a>, which are called "spriteswaps". These characters tend to have pretty awful controls and features. It doesn't help that many of them have jacked-up stats that make them overpowered. Given the fact that the spriteswaps' code is meant for a completely different character, hilarity is bound to ensue even if there aren't any modifications.

His characters have unblockable moves, moves that render the character invincible while using them, one-hit kills, and various other problems.

To start, every single character of his is a spriteswap, encompassing a wide variety of characters. While most of his characters are badly done Touhou characters, a few are hate characters of people he doesn't like, most likely because they bashed his works. In addition to spriteswapping, his characters tend to have sprites and palettes that range from awful to down-right horrifying to outright pornographic. Combined with equally bad soundpacks, several characters with jacked-up stats or overpowered moves, and a blatant disrespect for those that created the characters (even going as far as making an offensive spriteswap of a character whose author was <strong>deceased</strong>), and we have a real piece of work.

Namely, a level with glitched graphics to the point of unplayability, levels without any enemies, flat levels, levels which are nearly the exact same as the originals (except you're invisible), massive slow down, cut off, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnwinnable">unwinnable final boss</a> with no weaknesses or attacks. The biggest problem? Unlike most games listed here, which are usually only a few levels long, this game lasts for <em>nine whole worlds.</em> Somehow, an update actually made the game <em>worse</em>. Now instead of completely empty levels every so often, you've got wannabe kaizo levels thrown in every so often instead. Nothing about the annoying gimmick levels or glitched level or undefeatable final boss was fixed, but now what was once a mercifully quick to complete game takes about ten times longer.

The first five or so levels have zero challenge whatsoever and often no enemies or sprites in them, but it really, really starts to fall apart in 'level' 8. That level is just the SMW Bowser fight. Then the next one is just the first level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>, except you're permanently invincible, the next is another unedited SMW Bowser fight, except you're forced to be small, and while one final level is sort of new, the final real one is a completely unedited SMW level. It's just so lazy all around, and it's the author's fourth game in a row which could be classified as at least <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a>.

Sometimes top-down graphics like those from <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> are used in a side-view platformer and look hideous.</li><li> The music ranges from okay to awful, with some of it either having no samples in a song that needs them (which makes it sound like crap) and some ported songs that sound like the original as butchered by NES pirates. Just the horrific mess that's been made of the Cossack's Citadel stage 1 theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4">Mega Man 4</a></em> has to be heard to be believed.

At least six (Butter Bridge 2, Outrageous, Funky, Valley Fortress, Chocolate Secret and Donut Secret) are unedited from the original game (at least in Demo 3).</li><li> With the exception of a handful of levels, the whole thing has <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatchetScrolling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatchetScrolling">Ratchet Scrolling</a>, yet levels frequently require you to go left as well as right, resulting in multiple forced deaths.</li><li> Whole parts are blatantly ripped off from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212310/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario">Brutal Mario</a></em>, except without the quality ASM/programming gimmicks.

Some trainer and Pok&eacute;mon sprites are vomit-inducingly ugly, even forcing background palette errors. Johto and Hoenn Pok&eacute;mon can't evolve if you try to use them.

Probably the worst of these is <strong>Allen O'Neil See You In Hell Edition</strong>, which has all of the above flaws compounded by numerous Allen spawns.

If you've played one game, you've played them both.</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>FNaF: Left To Rust</strong></em> is a disaster. It uses various assets from the official games, and even a few from other fangames. Its story is positively nonsensical, perhaps even more than <em>The Return to Freddy's</em>; the "introduction" reads like a 10-year-old's poorly written <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212506/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a>. The animations are hastily made and incredibly janky, in both gameplay and cutscenes. The voice acting is pathetic and lifeless, and the dialogue is an edgy, ad-libbed mess.

The visuals are positively ugly; the textures on the obvious SFM models are a mess, the pizzeria itself looks dingy and wretched, and everything is festooned with vibrant greens, yellows, and reds. The gameplay is all over the place; it's glitchy, it has poorly executed <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212506/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">Unexpected Gameplay Changes</a>, and there are far too many animatronics and mechanics.

That should tell you what you're in for. It's extremely linear. The only weapon you get is the Mega Buster, whose ammo count goes into the negatives. The physics are completely off; pivot points are poorly placed on Mega Man's sprite, causing him to teleport a little when he turns around. The signature sliding move is utterly broken; it just warps Mega Man forward for a second and then returns him to his original position. Most stages are ripped off from official <em>Mega Man</em> games (the rest are ripped off from other NES games), but all of them are broken into single screens with no transitions at all. The enemies and bosses fight nothing like their established counterparts; most enemies will overwhelm you with a <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212506/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212506/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a>. The first two bosses' sound effects are horribly compressed. The user interface is the laziest; text is presented with the default Game Maker dialogue boxes (and riddled with typos), and the health bar, for whatever reason, is displayed on the game window's <em>title bar</em>, next to the "Minimize" and "Close" buttons.

And buying upgrades also increases the <em>enemies</em>' health, which defeats the purpose of upgrading in the first place (not that the single-use items are <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212506/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown">useful to begin with</a>).

Even if you could theoretically reach the <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212506/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, the game has <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212506/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">No Ending</a>; it just boots you back to the map afterwards.</li><li> <em><strong><a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230729212506/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrtRYzdyAEo">One-WAY<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230729212506im_/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"/></a></strong></em> is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212506/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki">Yume Nikki</a></em> fan game in which you play as Aitsuki and explore your dream world. It's undone by its incredibly unfitting music (which may have been stolen), <a class="twikilink" href="/web/20230729212506/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSPaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSPaint">MS Paint</a> backgrounds, and horrendous sprites (if <em>they</em> weren't stolen or recolored).

Worse still, the game is outright horribly optimized &#8212; despite being done with the Unity engine, it suffers regular framerate drops.</li></ul></div><hr/></p></div>
