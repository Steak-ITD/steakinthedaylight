                    <h2>Why...?</h2>

<p>I don't dislike Sonic. I think he'd be a fun target for whump, cause he's haughty, wouldn't take abuse lying down at first, until he has to accept the futility of the situation and figure out how to survive and cope, if he even can. I don't think I will keep this just focused on Sonic though, other characters could have an interesting story here. It could also have more general worldbuilding someday.</p>
<h2>What medium?</h2>
<p>Text and visual artwork, mainly.</p>
<h2>Changes to the world</h2>
                                        <p>Although they live on the same planet/world, humans and critters live much more isolated from each other. Their interactions are few and far between, and those that do happen are generally not positive. So they each stay out of each other's borders to avoid conflict and... other things.</p>
                                        <p>The characters in this universe are more mundane; Soonic can't run at the speed of sound but he's still faster than most others of his kind, Miles still has two tails but can't fly, etc.</p>
<p> 
                                        <h2> Basic Outline so far:</h2>
<img src="/Diminished Attitude/DA-sonic stages.jpg" class="responsive">
<p>Sonic, being a free spirit, doesn't like being restricted to any one area. He wants to explore, he wants space to run. So he sneaks outside the borders of his home to go see the sights. He doesn't think anything would happen to him. He's fast enough to get out of danger. And for a while, nothing does happen to him.</p>
<p>Until one day.</p>

<p>He finds a clearing in the woods. A nice, clear pond, not too deep. So he takes the opportunity to clean himself off a bit. He doesn't notice the hunters/poachers moving around in the woods. He doesn't hear the gunshot until after it hits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He tries to limp back into the woods for cover. He can limp faster than others, but it still isn't enough to outrun the hunters. They capture and contain him. They ignore his protests as if he isn't there. Talk about him like he's livestock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He's put into a dark vehicle so he can't see where they're taking him. They arrive at a far off facility, nothing else seemingly within miles. They inject him with a tranquilizer and put a tag on him. They also put a chip in him. Then they bring him to an area with a bunch if other hedgehogs. They are all made to do manual labor ( could be related to machine building ). They follow strict guidelines and schedules, have to fulfill a daily quota or be punished, can't socialize for extended periods of time. The food is just barely nourishing enough and harshly any sunlight gets in.</p>

<p>Sonic refuses to take this treatment at first. He is defiant and snappy towards the human employees. Doesn't answer when he's called ( they have letter-numbers on the tag, he wants them to use his name. They refuse). Lazes around to bother them. He gets punished for this, and they slowly escalate from being denied food and hygiene to physical violence. He fights back at this, until multiple employees are beating him at once and he can't overpower them.</p>

<p>He's confused why the other hedgehogs just take this abuse, why would you want to keep living like this? Most just want to survive by this point, live out their lives as least miserably as possible. Others are too panicked to do anything anymore. Many of them pity Sonic for his attitude, which he doesn't appreciate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chips have a shock function. After several weeks/months, the employees start using Sonic's. They want him to associate insubordination/acting on his own with pain, loss of autonomy. This is on top of the beating punishments. He doesn't let them see they're getting to him at first, acting like the shocks don't bother him. Until they become too strong to ignore, stopping him in his tracks, leaving him dazed for a minute.</p>

<p>Throughout his time, he has been observing the place; looking for any openings where he could be out of sight, when the employees are the least busy, the building structure. He eventually forms a plan and then enacts it. It appears to go well, managing to get outside the building and towards the surrounding thick jungle. He doesn't realize how desperate he is, &nbsp;doesn't realize things seem too easy.</p>
<p>He's close to the jungle now, it's just within reach. He's ready to run through in joy to celebrate his freedom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He crosses a certain point. The facility is surrounded by an invisible barrier connected to the chips. Crossing through with one activates the highest electricity level immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pain is horrifying. Sonic's muscles convulse hard enough to break bones in his legs. The shock is causing him to hyperventilate. He falls to the ground and finds himself unable to get up. But he's so close. He has to crawl, he has to get there, get through this endless shocking. His vision is blurry, with tears and fatigue and he can't stop shaking but he can't give up. He's almost there...</p>

<p>...he is grabbed by someone behind him, a guard, out of nowhere. Was it out of nowhere? He is too exhausted to fully realize what's going on, knowing only that he's still being electrocuted and the jungle is escaping him. He struggles, reaches out his hand, whines. He was so close, it was withing his reach, why is it leaving? The shocking stops as they approach the building (any longer would have put him into cardiac arrest) but he still convulses, his breaths are still short and frantic, he can't think or see straight.</p>

<p>He's brought to a new, small room. The only thing there is a door on the ground. The guard presses something to open it up, revealing a well filled with dirty water. Sonic knows what is about to happen. He is thrown in unceremoniously and the door closes.</p>

<p>He can't push it open. He can't get any air. He can't stay afloat with his legs broken. He sinks to the bottom. There are corpses down here. He's to frantic to hold his breath, can't keep thrashing for long, eventually he slows down, and his body gives out, his mind following soon after.</p>

<p>To his surprise, he wakes up with a start, laying in his bed cot. Confused but sluggish, he turns to see someone new, a higher up in the facility. He mocks Sonic; did he really think he was the first to try this? That they wouldn't have measures to prevent escape? They always had their eyes on him. They only let him think he got far. They let him survive the shock. They let him survive the drowning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boss makes it clear that he is a simple animal, and humans are more powerful. He is no more useful to them alive than dead (his fur and quills could go for thousands). He is at their mercy, he'll never be free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His life is theirs to use.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="/Diminished Attitude/submission.jpeg" class="responsive">
<p>Sonic's demeanor changes from here on.<br />His rebellious streaks are few and far between. The shocks have embedded into his being. He can't think as fast as he used to. He's more frightful now, of making a mistake, getting the shock again, making him lose something more. He still twitches involuntarily. When he thinks of doing something for himself, he thinks he can feel the electricity again (sometimes it's real, sometimes it isn't) thinks he smells burning flesh, thinks he can see the jolts, feel blood pouring from his left eye.</p>

<p>Unable to move himself for a while, he has to be ferried everywhere by an employee, who tends to make a show of it to the other hedgehogs. He doesn't look back, doesn't try to interact with them anymore. He hates being looked down on, having to be moved like this, no autonomy of his own. He hates being treated like some skittish animal, and he hates that he's becoming one.</p>

<p>One day he looks into a mirror, unsure what he's seeing. There's a mangled, messy hedgehog in it. His left eye is bloodshot and scarred, his untagged ear is torn, his quills are uneven, he's missing a fang. He's constantly shaking. He reaches out a hand to this hedgehog, only to realize it's his hand, reaching to his own. He keeps staring into his own eyes, holding his own hand. He cries at the sight, the feelings, the unfamiliarity of the creature staring back at him. Who is he...?</p>

<p>This place has ruined him, he no longer recognizes himself. He may as well be a living corpse... he wishes sometimes that... they did let him die- no no no but he can't think that! Can't let them have that too, can't lose anything else.</p>

<p>He has nightmares sometimes. They are somewhat abstract, but they share a them of surrender; they hammer in his helplessness, convince him to give into his capture, remind him he's powerless, no matter what he does he will never be free. His life belongs to the facility. He usually forgets the dreams within the day, but the dread never leaves him.</p>

<p>Eventually after a year, maybe 2, he gets rescued. Some rights group raids the place and they save as many critters as they can as well as arrest workers they find. Course the facility has a backup plan and a few of them including the boss get away with some of the critters to relocate, so on.</p>

<p>Being saved is stressful for Sonic. He's not sure if he should go, if this is a test of his loyalty. It doesn't help that the rescuers are mostly humans; his image of them is fairly distorted. He remembers the barrier, the burning pain. He can't go back out there, it's too risky. They have to force him out eventually. Being grabbed and help is terrifying for him too. He screams and cries and convulses, the shocks are back he didn't do anything he didn't try to run why is this happening why why why-</p>

<p>He passes out at some point and wakes up in a hospital room. Someone is there to greet him. They ask him his name. It catches him off guard; it's been so long since he was asked. It takes him a bit to respond. It sounds foreign to him as it leaves his mouth. It's explained to him that the chip is gone, the tag is gone, he's safe now and they are helping him recover from his wounds. He will get to go home soon. He listens and nods. But he's still filled with dread, still has an itching feeling that this is all a trick, the shocking will return any minute. He has to let it pass.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="/Diminished Attitude/DA-sonic pity.jpg" class="responsive">
<p>After he is returned to his home, he can let it sink in that he's free now. It is all behind him now. He wants to keep it that way. He insists to others not to walk on eggshells around him. He doesn't want to be pitied. He won't admit he is still afraid of stepping out of line, of being punished for acting on his own. He acts like he's fine, just happy to be back, no issue other than the occasional convulsion.</p>

<p>There is always lingering dread. That none of this is real. The sun seems too bright, the air too cool. He doesn't think this can last. They got away. They'll come for their property. He couldn't get away last time. Next time it will be worse. He doesn't want to think like this, he knows it's not true, he knows that but the fear refuses to leave him.</p>

<p>The memories haunt him too. Metal clanging reminds him of the work he had to do. He freezes at the sound of electricity. Water... he had already preferred viewing from afar, but now the sight of it made his fur stand on end. Images of rotting corpses fill his head, the taste of that dirty water comes back to him. He feels sick.</p>

<p>Their words play on repeat in his head. He will never be free. His life is theirs to use. He supposes they're right. He isn't free. Their influence is still felt, the scars are still there. The memories, the dreams, the fear instilled into him. His mind still belongs to them even if his body isn't in their grasp for now.</p>

<p>It could go a couple ways from here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This could all become too much for Sonic. He can't feel like himself anymore, can't take the reoccurring fear and the phantom pain. No matter what they will always be there. So he decides to go where they can't follow him. (Wondering if this would be by &nbsp; falling of a cliff by the ocean-side or cutting open his throat as if trying to remove the phantom chip. Leaning towards former)</p>

<p>He may finally learn to open up, accept he's not ok and let himself be "weak" around others. He could face his acquired fears, learning to handle and cope with them, and figure out how to find himself again, even if he won't be the same.</p>
