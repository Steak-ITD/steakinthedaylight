                    <p class="aligncenter">This is actually a very old animation from high school. I still like what was done for it, so I'm showcasing it here. I realize now it's pretty slow paced, and my method of animating frame by frame is probably even more tedious than that method requires, hah. This shows a species of dragon I made up, a pond dragon, and the many sizes they can come in, from the size of a small human to tiny enough to fit into your palm.</p>
                    <h1>Animation Memes</h1>
                    <p class="aligncenter">I even managed to make some of these back in the day! Just 3, though. Here they are converted into videos. All starring koopas, because that's just what I did years ago.</p>
