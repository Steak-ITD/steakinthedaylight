                        <h1>Duck Life Lore (WIP)</h1>
                        <p>In this world ducks are known as being highly intelligent and adventurous animals, despite their small unassuming stature. A unifying trait between most of them is their need for challenge.</p>
<p><b>Duck Life 1</b>. By this time humans are not as dominant a species on the planet, and the few they are create relationships with ducks, who are slowly overtaking it more. They live together on farms and enter competitions together to earn money needed to keep these places running.</p>
<p>By <b>Duck Life 2</b>. the humans are few and far between, a rare species but not thought much of. However their influence lives on in duck society. They overtake the cities and other establishments, so there isn't much of an "apocalypse" per se. More like a natural restructuring of dominance. The ducks are still known for their competitive streaks and racing is huge in their culture.</p>
<p><b>Duck Life 3</b>. Ducks are becoming smarter and more self sufficient. They are able to learn the science of genetic modification, but immediately turn and use this on themselves alone. This creates new soecies of duck specifically for categories of physicality such as flying swimming running and climbing. It ends up creating both unfair advntages and useless ones all at once. After it was found that the genes became unatable enough as to create abominable duck beings that no longer resembled the birds, genetic modification was outlawed. It is possible that is continues somewhere in the world, but as a rule of thumb this law is followed. Nothing has stopped the already modified ducks from breeding, so some of their traits continue to be seen in newer and newer generations, though as time goes on the traits are not as strong, which evens out races.</p>
<p><b>Duck Life 4</b>. After the lessened presence of scientific achievement, magic starts to grow in usage, albeit at a much slower rate. Some ducks have already become incredible experts in its usage, including one arrogant duck that reigns supreme in races, gaining the abilities of pyromancy and levitation. It takes a team of 6 in order to defeat it and end its reign.</p>
<p><b>Duck Life 5.</b> By this point humans have become a distant memory, and ducks are beginning to expand their racing roots and explore new venues. Treasures as old as time are discovered in many caves around the world. Of course it still becomes a race to find the biggest gains.</p>
<p>With the treasures that are found, ducks begin to expand their own societies, moving further away from human roots while still retaining some of their old trends. They move away from far lives and expand into more cities and suburbs, small villages littered throught the world scattered within wilderness. More of these places have become built around the training that ducks do for their races.</p>
<p>TBC: <b>Duck Life 6</b></p>
<p><b>Duck Life 7</b> shows that some ducks have begun seeking new challenge and thrill. They begin popularizing a new sport: battling each other with gear and weapons. It's much more dangerous than races but loved nonetheless and even has dedicated tournaments and islands to hist battles. There is little friction between race fans and battle fans. It's simply a new way to challenge one's self.</p>
<p>By <b>Duck Life 8</b> the duck society has grown in size and scope to encompass many of the same things humans once did. Curiously they don't interact as much with other wildlife unless it has to do with the training for races and battles in which they become obstacles to overcome. Their diets are still almost entirely seeds.</p>
<p>This period of time is where <a href=/Gallery/beebee_lore.html>Beebee</a>  and <a href=/Gallery/jexity_intro.html>Jexity</a> hail from.</p>
