                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> Showcasing a bit of Klug's impulsivness and obsession. The title is meant to imply this isn't the first time or the first person he's done something like this to. I have also thought of Feli being socially anxious, making the situation worse for her.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"Hello there, Lemres!" Klug smiled. He didn't have to put it on. It just came to him, whenever he saw his friend.</p>
                    <p>"Hi Klug! How are you?" Lemres waved at him.</p>
                    <p>"Great now that you're here. Might you come over to my house? I've come up with some new card tricks I would love to show you.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't this week. I already made plans with Feli."</p>
                    <p>Klug felt his smile falter. A pinch of rage hit him, but he kept it to himself, and said, "Ah. I see."</p>
                    <p>"I'm free next week though! We can hang out then, is that ok?"</p>
                    <p>"Of course, I would love to. You have fun, now." Klug waved back and watched Lemres leave his sight.</p>
                    <p>Then, he stood there. Stewing in this anger that grew so suddenly.</p>
                    <p>No, it wasn't sudden, was it? He knew why he felt this way. He wanted to be with his friend. But that girl. She took his time away from them. It wasn't acceptable.</p>
                    <p>He would have to do something about that. No worries, it would be easy, he thought. He was sure he knew what people feared by now. He just needed a bit more information first.</p>

                    <p>Feli felt at peace tonight. She was home by herself now, but she was more than old enough to handle that. She laid in her bed, a small lamp on, reading an interesting book about the zodiac animals.</p>
                    <p>She almost didn't hear the sound of something scraping against a window. But it caught her attention briefly. She didn't mind it at first, thinking it must be some bird or something. But the sound continued. Against her better judgment, she started to get a little worried. It probably wouldn't hurt to check, even if it was nothing.</p>
                    <p>She got out of bed to go check on the sound. Walking downstairs, the scraping continued, and then it was replaced with a window opening.</p>
                    <p>"Mom? Dad? Is that you?" Did they forget their keys? That was weird, they knew she was home. Her worry began to grow. She got no response, and heard soft footsteps next, unsure where they were headed. "Hello?"</p>
                    <p>Still no response. She went into the living room and saw the wide open window. Turning on the light, she didn't see anyone around. She walked closer to the window; the lock was half turned, just enough to be unlocked. It was locked before, wasn't it? Someone... was in her house.</p>
                    <p>"Who's there? Show yourself!" She tried to sound brave, managing not to sound as shaky as she felt.</p>
                    <p>Someone stepped into the dark entryway. She could only see the glint from his glasses. "Hello, Feli." He spoke in a low voice.</p>
                    <p>"Klug?" Feli finally recognized him once he stepped further into the light. "What... How did you... What are you doing here?"</p>
                    <p>"I just want to talk." He began to approach her.</p>
                    <p>"How do you know where I live?"</p>
                    <p>"I do my research. But don't worry about that." His approach was very slow, which made it worse for Feli. She backed up against the wall. She wasn't sure what else to do, and she didn't know what he was capable of. She couldn't read his face.</p>
                    <p>"What do you want to 'talk' about?" She asked, again trying to hide her fear.</p>
                    <p>"You have been spending a lot of time with Lemres. Taking time away from us. I don't like it."</p>
                    <p>That confused her. She was pretty sure she had spent a normal amount of time with Lemres. "So? We're friends, that's what friends do."</p>
                    <p>"I think..." The glint faded from his glasses. She looked into his eyes; squinted, but unblinking, somehow hiding his emotion. "... it would be in your best interest if you left him alone."</p>
                    <p>"I'm not afraid of you," she declared. He was very close now. Her uncertainty increased. She wanted to run, wanted to hit him, but his face had scared her into stillness. Something wasn't right about him.</p>
                    <p>Klug caught on to her quickly. She showed plenty of signs of being afraid and anxious. He could take advantage of that. He chuckled and grinned. "Are you sure about that?"</p>
                    <p>He quickly put his hands on the wall, blocking Feli in. She gasped at the sudden motion. She should have fled, but now she didn't have the chance.</p>
                    <p>"I don't want anything bad to happen, you know." He whispered, still staring at her right in the eyes. "I just want to spend time with <em>my</em> friend. That's all. Don't take that away from me."</p>
                    <p>He finally backed up. Feli dared not feel a sense of relief, lest he do something else. "Ok," she muttered, not sure what else to say. She just wanted him to leave.</p>
                    <p>Their eye contact broke as he turned away, heading for the door. "Have a good night," he said, and she could not tell how he meant that.</p>
                    <p>She only relaxed when she heard the front door open and close. But not much. She shifted to the ground. Her heart still raced, and her breath was fast. Her hands wouldn't stop shaking. She didn't know why, he hadn't done anything to her, right?</p>
                    <p>But it still freaked her out so much. Especially his stare. It felt wrong. He seemed to know exactly how to scare her, almost like it was practiced.</p>
                    <p>When she calmed down enough to think straighter, she went back to her room, to the comfort of her bed. She decided she needed to tell someone. Before it got worse.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> I'll make a small picture to kind of wrap this up, show the aftermath of doing things like this. Feli does tell someone what happened, and it causes others to speak up, culminating in Klug's eventual admittance.</p>
