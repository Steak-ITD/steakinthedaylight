                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> It's a kind of introductory phase. I think the next group session I will write should have them getting to know each other more with an icebreaker.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"Good morning everyone," Ms. Accord announced as she sat in the circle of chairs with the patients. "Welcome to our first group session. You can call me Ms. Accord. I believe some of us have met already, but why don't we begin by introducing ourselves?" She looked over to her left. "Can you tell us your name and something interesting about yourself?"</p>

                    <p>The blond girl gave a wide smile. "My name is Amitie, and I'm a magician! Well, I will be soon!" She let out a giggle and waved to everyone else.</p>
                    
                    <p>Accord waved back to her. "Thank you, Amitie. Nice to meet you. How about you?"</p>
                    
                    <p>A girl in a wheelchair looked up, a little shocked. "Um, my name is Lidelle, and, um... I..." She looked back down and fiddled with her shirt. "... Sorry, I'm not very interesting..."</p>
                    
                    <p>"It's ok, you can say anything you like," Accord said.</p>
                    
                    <p>Lidelle thought for a moment, and said, "I like to style my hair sometimes..."</p>
                    
                    <p>"That's very nice. I can't wait to see what you come up with." Accord smiled at Lidelle, who blushed in turn. "Let's keep going around the room."</p>
                    
                    <p>The boy next to her took something from his pocket: a keyboard phone. He started typing, and it spoke.</p> <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif">Sig. I like to draw bugs.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Nice to meet you. I hope we get to see some of those drawings." Accord replied, and Sig nodded.</p>
                    
                    <p>The next in the circle, a bespeckled boy, pouted. "I'm Klug. And I don't belong here."</p>
                    
                    <p>"Hmm," Accord wasn't sure how to respond at first. "Even so, I hope your stay hasn't been too bad so far." He simply shrugged.</p>
                    
                    <p>The last girl in the circle spoke up immediately after. "My name is Raffina. I come from a prestigious family, and I have a lot of expensive clothes! But I couldn't even bring most of it here, because it was too 'dangerous' I guess?" She let out a dramatic sigh.</p>
                    
                    <p>Accord laughed and replied, "Sorry to hear that. Are the clothes here comfortable at least?"</p>
                    
                    <p>"Yeah, they feel ok, and at least they had them in my favorite colors."</p>
                    
                    <p>Meanwhile, Klug seemed to be eyeing Raffina suspiciously. "Hey, I think I know you. Aren't you that girl that tried to kill someone?"</p>
                    
                    <p>Raffina froze, before speaking again furiously. "I-I-I wasn't trying to kill her! I j-just got a bit wound up and I, uh, maybe lost it a little! But-"</p>
                    
                    <p>"Are we sure it's safe with her around?"</p>
                    
                    <p>"Y-yes, I am perfectly *safe* to be around, thank you very much!"</p>
                    
                    <p>"Now now," Accord spoke up over the conversation. "It is true Raffina had an 'incident' before arriving here. But that's why we're all here together. To help each other heal. Isn't that right?</p>
                    
                    <p>Raffina looked down and kicked her feet. "R-right..."</p>
                    
                    <p>Klug crossed his arms. "If you say so."</p>
                    
                    <p>The other three nodded in agreement.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Good. Again, it's a pleasure to meet you all," Accord said, trying to bring back cheer. "I'm looking forward to learning more about you, and seeing what we can all accomplish together."</p>
                    
                    <p>"We'll be having these sessions weekly and more confidential one-on-one sessions on a different day. Does anyone have any questions?"</p>
                    
                    <p>Amitie eagerly raises her hand. "Is there gonna be a drawing session too?"</p>
                    
                    <p>"That will be another activity in the week you can join. But feel free to bring in any drawings you do there." The room was silent for a bit, so Accord continued. "I think we'll stop for today if there are no other questions. Our next sessions should be longer. Thank you all for coming."</p>
                    
                    <p>As everyone began to leave the room, Accord thought it had been a little awkward, but first times are usually like that. Things could go smoother over time, as everyone became accustomed.</p>
