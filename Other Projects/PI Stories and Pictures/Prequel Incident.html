                    <p style= "color:#b30000; font-size:125%;"> Violence, though described abstractly</p>
                    <p style= "color:blue; font-size:120%;"> This story describes the inciting incident that caused Raffina to be admitted. I tried to portray a frantic pace to represent her racing mind and elation. Also, Arabella and Sena are the names I came up with for her older sisters.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Raffina was perfectly fine.</p>
                    <p>Completely, absolutely, perfectly fine.</p>
                    <p>Her function was great. She didn't need to sleep for the past few days. But that was fine. It's good that she didn't even feel like sleeping, because that was more time she could focus on her work. So many designs to try. So many ideas. They kept coming and coming and coming. Her mind wouldn't stop racing with ideas. It was good.</p>
                    <p>She looked into the mirror. Her eyes were wide open, but the bags were quite obvious. Oh well, nothing a bit of makeup can't fix! She grabbed some from the cupboard behind the mirror. Her hands were rather shaky, but that was ok. She had practiced this so many times.</p>
                    <p>She took a deep breath and applied some concealer. Not too bright, not too much on top. There, perfect as always. She smiled in the mirror. A big wide smile. She was feeling pretty energetic already, she couldn't stop shaking.</p>
                    <p>Raffina went downstairs to eat breakfast. It was a plate of pancakes and turkey bacon. She took a bite out of it. It tasted like nothing...? Maybe she ate it a little too fast? She took another bite, making sure to savor it this time.</p>
                    <p>Still nothing.</p>
                    <p>Maybe she just wasn't hungry. That's ok. Just more time to work. This was fine too.</p>
                    <p>"Hey sis, you alright? You're picking at your food," Arabella said next to her.</p>
                    <p>"I'm ok. Great even. I don't think I need to eat today. Super excited to get back to work. I've got so many new ideas, you know." Raffina spoke so quickly.</p>
                    <p>"Ah, well, you should still eat you know. Don't want to lose all that energy."</p>
                    <p>"I won't! It's good! Gosh, I'm already so excited to just <em>get working</em>," I... " she didn't finish. She didn't want to. She had to expend this energy. She got up from the table and went back to her room, not hearing her sister call out after her.</p>
                    <p>She looked over at the cloth and supplies she had. Wonderful, colorful cloth ripe for the taking. Oh, she was going to make something beautiful today, she just knew it.</p>
                    <p>Pulling several pieces of cloth together, she went over to her sewing machine. And she put pieces together, in all the patterns in her head. There were so many, she didn't know where to start. But it was fine because her body seemed to be moving on its own as she started the machine and moved the pieces in time with the machine.</p>
                    <p>It was so colorful, and spontaneous. Yes, this was all so wonderful. The way each color clashed with each other as if fighting a wild battle. It was absolutely stunning! She could work all day!</p>
                    <p>But it seemed like life had other plans, as she reached for another piece of cloth, only to find nothing in her hands. Had she used it <em>all</em> already? She must have been <em>really</em> invested in this piece. She took it off the machine and looked over at it.</p>
                    <p>It was... Kind of a mess. The colors did indeed clash, but in a way that stood out too much. She had her brain so full of ideas, that she seemed to have used them all at once, and it made this disaster.</p>
                    <p>Raffina stared at it for a while. More thoughts raced in her mind.</p>
                    <p>'What were you thinking? Well, this apparently. Too much. It's all too much. And now look what you've done. All this cloth wasted on a mess like this. It's... It's...'</p>
                    <p>She felt enraged. She was <em>better</em> than this. Her hands shook, and she whined. Her body seemed to move on its own again, and suddenly, shreds of cloth were in the air, floating slowly down to the ground. Colors everywhere. Slowly turning the room into a rainbow.</p>
                    <p>When she was done, she still felt angry. Now it was really wasted cloth. Wasted <em>time</em>. No, this simply wouldn't do. She would just have to try again. More ideas were coming to her. Her mind wouldn't stop, it wouldn't stop for just one second-</p>
                    <p>No, it was fine. It was good. She could get more cloth. It'd be a chore but she could do it. She quickly grabbed her purse and went out the door, and through her home to the exit.</p>
                    <p>Ah, it was pretty colorful outside already. The sun had started to set. Had she been working that long? That was... Good, that was good, she didn't feel tired or hungry or thirsty, that was good. She focused for so long! If only it had bore better fruit. Oh well.</p>
                    <p>She kept walking towards the craft store. Lots of cloth there, and more supplies. As she walked in she felt overwhelmed with passion. There was. SO MUCH. She wanted to buy as much as she could. Immediately grabbing a cart, she started filling it with cloth, and pin cushions, and pins, and more and more things...</p>
                    <p>Once she left the store, she looked again at everything she bought. Wow... She bought a <em>lot</em> of stuff. There were a lot of colors, some she hadn't even considered in so long. Was she really going to use all this?</p>
                    <p>Well, of course, she had so many ideas, that it only made sense to have so many materials. It was fine, it was all just fine.</p>
                    <p>"Well look who it is! Oh Raffina, when aren't you a mess?"</p>
                    <p>Oh great, it was <em>that</em> girl, the one from school, who was always heckling her. Calling her crazy because of her... Moods. "I don't have time for you. I have a lot of work to do actually-"</p>
                    <p>"Is that what you call those shambles you like to present? How laughable! Only a nutjob like you would call that fashion."</p>
                    <p>Raffina was getting very upset. She almost wanted to rip her cloth up again. But she wouldn't. She wasn't a nutjob, she was fine, and she would prove it. "Yes, it's <em>work</em>, and I work <em>hard</em>, not like you would know anything about that!"</p>
                    <p>The girl laughed at her. It was loud, and it seemed like it wouldn't stop. It was all she could hear. Raffina grits her teeth. "Enough! I am not going to take this any longer!"</p>
                    <p>"Face it, freak, no matter how much cloth you throw at it, your designs are always going to be a disaster. Do us all a favor and spare our eyes for once, ok?" And she laughed again.</p>
                    <p>It wouldn't stop.</p>
                    <p>None of it would stop. The laughing. The thoughts. The rage she felt.</p>
                    <p>She just wanted peace for once.</p>
                    <p>She wasn't fine.</p>
                    <p>But that was ok. She could make things fine, just like she always did.</p>
                    <p>And suddenly, all the colors of cloth disappeared, and the sounds of her head mixed until it was just clear white noise.</p>
                    <p>She felt floaty, moving fast through the air until she reached an impact.</p>
                    <p>A knot, perhaps. A twisted knot in her cloth. There was only one way out; to tear it. Rip it apart with force.</p>
                    <p>The laughing stopped too. It became white noise as well, constant and steady.</p>
                    <p>She could only see red now, in the sky, from the sunlight, on the ground, and her hands.</p>
                    <p>Yes, Raffina was finally doing it! Making a masterpiece to put the rest to shame! That would show that awful girl, it would show everyone! Things were ok again, and she had made it that way.</p>
                    <p>She was fine.</p>
                    <p><strong>fine, fine, fine, fine, fine</strong></p>
                    <p>Something grabbed her. She pushed it away. She was busy with her work, and couldn't be interrupted now. It grabbed her again. But there was more of it now. She pushed and pushed, but it got stronger. No, she had to keep going! There was so much more to do!</p>
                    <p>It pulled her away anyhow. She looked back. It was a big, burly guy, and he was holding her tightly. She recognized him as someone else from school.</p>
                    <p>"Raffina, you have to calm down."</p>
                    <p>"What? I'm calm, I'm-"</p>
                    <p>She looked around. Where did all these people come from? Why were they staring at her?</p>
                    <p>She looked back down to where she had been. That girl was there, but she wasn't moving. Not making a sound. Just laying there. Covered in red.</p>
                    <p>'What? What happened? Did I? No, that doesn't make sense, I wouldn't, I would never...'</p>
                    <p>Her mind raced, her breath raced, her legs raced, but she couldn't go anywhere.</p>
                    <p>"No, no, I just, I was working, then she came, and I just... No, no, no," she couldn't stop. She wanted it all to stop. There was too much noise, in and out.</p>
                    <p>She had been fine, how had this happened?</p>
                    <img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" class="responsive" />
                    <p>The next moment was a blur.</p>
                    <p>Raffina was held in custody. She had been mumbling all the way. Now painfully aware of what happened, and what followed.</p>
                    <p>She didn't know how long she was there. She didn't want to know and didn't bother trying to count.</p>
                    <p>Her family came eventually. She heard them from outside. They were arguing. She didn't hear about what.</p>
                    <p>Soon she was released to them. They immediately went to hug her. She didn't know how to feel. Or if she could even feel anything at all.</p>
                    <p>"I'm sorry," she whimpered. "I just kept telling myself I was fine, and I <em>was</em>, but..." she trailed off.</p>
                    <p>"See? I told you we should have paid more attention! Those 'moods' weren't just a phase!" Arabella yelled.</p>
                    <p>"Alright, alright..." Her dad said. "How were we supposed to know? Teenagers have moods all the time."</p>
                    <p>"Not like this, not where she can hardly even eat or sleep! You just ignored it, and now she could be in real trouble!"</p>
                    <p>"Calm down, we are in public. And she won't get in trouble. We'll figure out how to handle this." He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>
                    <p>"W-w-what should I d-do?" Raffina was on the verge of tears.</p>
                    <p>Sena came to comfort her. "I think you should get some sleep, sweetie. You look very tired. We'll make sure things turn out ok."</p>
                    <p>Raffina nodded. She still didn't feel tired, but she would try. She didn't want to cause any more trouble.</p>
                    <img src="/Asset/line-separator-clipart-31.png" class="responsive" />
                    <p>News of the "incident" spread through the area. Everyone knew about the youngest daughter of the local rich folk going mad and attacking a classmate. The parents had to figure out how to explain what happened, and how she wasn't insane. Eventually, it was decided that Raffina should get more professional help.</p>
                    <p>With accounts from her family and herself, her extreme mood shifts were given a name: bipolar disorder. She had had a manic episode. She had never heard of it, but it made sense.</p>
                    <p>Her "high" had since passed. Now she felt very, very "low".</p>
                    <p>Her she was, in front of Primp Institute. A place meant to keep her safe. She and others. Keep them safe from her.</p>
                    <p>She had no idea what the future held now, and it scared her. Would this place really help her? There was only one way to find out...</p>
