                    <h1>Artificial Monsters</h1>
                    <p>A zine made to prove creativity is possible using AI if you put effort into it. This was before AI became so prominent, so it it somewhat regretable. <a href="/Zines/Artifimon Final.pdf" download>Download it here.</a></p>
                    <img src="/Zines/Bad Influence_page-0001.jpg" class="altresponsive">
                    <h1>Bad Influence</h1>
                    <p>A very short sketch zine about a certain theme, exploring the intersection of innocence and sin. Contains sexual artwork.<a href="/Zines/Bad Influence.pdf" download>You can find it here.</a></p>
                    <img src="/Zines/Shifting Gardens.jpg" class="altresponsive">
                    <h1>Shifting Gardens</h1>
                    <p>My first zine; it holds a special place in my heart. This is an experimental fanzine of artwork and text featuring grass-type Pokemon in various perilous situations. Not all of them will necessarily feature gore, but a theme in all of them is some sort of body modification/desecration. Features 6 images with text to go along. Contains violent artwork.</p>
                    <p>This zine has a <a href="/Zines/Shifting Gardens Final.pdf" download>digital version</a> and a <a href="/Zines/Shifting Gardens Final Book Print.pdf" download>version for print</a>.</p>

                    <h1>Different Every Time</h1>
                    <p>A hodgepodge mess of a Sonic fanzine. Named after the fact that the characters look different every time I draw them. Contains sexual and violent artwork.<a href="/Zines/Different Every Time.pdf" download>Read this thing here.</a></p>

                    <p><strong>These zines were made with Electric Zine Maker.</strong></p>

                    <h1>Stract Zine</h1>
                    <p>A maximalist, meaningless, abstract zine made entirely with my own art pieces, randomly strewn together and edited to create a messy overstimulating aesthetic. <a href="/Zines/Stract.pdf" download>Here is the pdf version</a>, and <a href="/Zines/Stract print.png" download>an 8 fold print version.</a></p>

                    <h1>Misery and Misanthropy Zine</h1>
                    <p>A zine made in 2022, at the peak of my sadness. One of them, anyway. A series of kind-of disconnected thoughts put into visual form via collage and drawing. It's been described to me as maximalist. Slight warning for crudely drawn violence and small sexuality at the end. <a href="/Zines/Not_Candy_M&M.pdf" download>Read it here.</a> Or <a href="/Zines/Not_Candy_M&M.png" download>print it out and 8 fold it.</a></p>

                    <h1>My story is I have no story</h1>
                    <p>Another zine I made while feeling sad, this time about my lack of noteriety, kind of. Mainly made of photos. <a href="/Zines/No Story.pdf" download>You know the drill.</a> No print version yet.</p>
