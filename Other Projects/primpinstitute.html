                        <h2>Intro</h2>
                        <p>It came to me in a dream...</p>
                        <p>This is a "modern-day" AU where the Primp kids are in an institution for their mental health issues. They are all older teens in this AU, 16-17. It takes place around 2004-2005.</p>
                        <p>I do need to research a bit on what these places were like back then.</p>
                        <h2>Mediums</h2>
                        Ideally a mix of comic and fan fiction, but probably leaning more towards written vignettes. I don't have a full plotline yet so right now I would be making a kind of anthology series.
                        <h2>Characters</h2>
                        <p>Sig is severely autistic. He barely talks to people unless he needs to be understood quickly, mostly communicating through writing. He can't handle bright light or loud noise, so his room is always dark. He frequently brings bugs inside and whispers to them. He often grabs his head, sometimes pulling out his hair, from stress.</p>
                        <p>Amitie is schizophrenic. She hears voices in her head telling her she is a powerful magician. She believes it is her job to help everyone somehow, but doesn't know how and sometimes makes issues worse. She tries to be optimistic but is deeply anxious about everything around her, and puts a lot of pressure on herself. She also has PTSD from losing much of her family at a young age.</p>
                        <p>Lidelle is majorly depressed and also has physical deformities putting her in a wheelchair. She has PTSD from the way her family treated her. She hates herself deeply and has to sometimes be forced to take care of herself. She believes she deserves all the bad things that happen in her life.</p>
                        <p>Raffina has bipolar disorder with severe elevated moods and mania. She is often very irritable in both of her moods. Her family was content to just push her emotional issues aside (it's all in your head type deal) until a certain incident occurred. Then they send her there to save face.</p>
                        <p>Klug has antisocial personality disorder. He is extremely impulsive and has grand yet vague visions of himself. He hates being at the institution and frequently tries to escape or act like everything is fine.</p>
                        <p>Accord is a worker at the institution. She has only been with this group for a little while but she cares for them a lot. She wants to help them live their best while integrating back outside the institution, but circumstances make this difficult. Popoi is a regular cat, and she often brings her with her for emotional support.</p>
