                        <h2>Intro</h2>
                        <p>The idea for this AU came to me in a dream. I suppose I had been thinking about mental health lately, and it subconsciously translated into this.</p>
                        <p>This is a "modern-day" AU where the Primp kids are in an institution for their mental health issues. They are all older teens in this AU, 16-17. It takes place around 2004-2005.</p>
                        <h2>Mediums</h2>
                        <p>Ideally a mix of comic and fan fiction, but probably leaning more towards written vignettes. I don't have a full plotline yet so right now I would be making a kind of anthology series.</p>
                        <h2>Characters</h2>
                        <p>Sig is severely autistic. He barely talks to people unless he needs to be understood quickly, mostly communicating through writing. He can't handle bright light or loud noise, so his room is always dark. He frequently brings bugs inside and whispers to them. He often grabs his head, sometimes pulling out his hair, from stress.</p>
                        <p>Amitie is schizophrenic. She hears voices in her head telling her she is a powerful magician. She believes it is her job to help everyone somehow, but doesn't know how and sometimes makes issues worse. She tries to be optimistic but is deeply anxious about everything around her, and puts a lot of pressure on herself. She also has PTSD from losing much of her family at a young age.</p>
                        <p>Lidelle is majorly depressed and also has physical deformities putting her in a wheelchair. She has PTSD from the way her family treated her. She hates herself deeply and has to sometimes be forced to take care of herself. She believes she deserves all the bad things that happen in her life.</p>
                        <p>Raffina has bipolar disorder with severe elevated moods and mania. She is often very irritable in both of her moods. Her family was content to just push her emotional issues aside (it's all in your head type deal) until a certain incident occurred. Then they send her there to save face.</p>
                        <p>Klug has antisocial personality disorder. He is extremely impulsive and has grand yet vague visions of himself. He hates being at the institution and frequently tries to escape or act like everything is fine.</p>
                        <p>Accord is a worker at the institution. She has only been with this group for a little while but she cares for them a lot. She wants to help them live their best while integrating back outside the institution, but circumstances make this difficult. Popoi is a regular therapy cat, and she often brings him with her for emotional support.</p>                 
                        <h2>A little backstory</h2>
<p>The kids did not have very happy lives or supportive people in them.</p>
<p>Sig&#39;s family simply did not want to deal with him. They would rather have had a &quot;normal&quot; boy. So they sent him away. He&#39;s dissappointed, but tries not to think about it so much. </p>
<p>Amitie&#39;s family seems to have been struck with misfortune. One death after another, from various causes. Losing so many people caused her a lot of grief, and she feels like she has to make up for it somehow, maybe with her &quot;powers&quot;. She originally was at an orphanage before being sent to the institution.</p>
<p>Lidelle was born with congenital limb defects in both her legs, having an undergrowth over time. Her family did not treat her well, beliving her to have been cursed, or bad in another life. She also faced bullying in school for being in a wheelchair. It all affected her personally. Her family eventually sent her away when the opportunity came.</p>
<p>Raffina&#39;s family chose to ignore her problems for the longest time. They cared a lot about appearances and wanted to seem as perfect as possible. She was told to either hide or snap out of her intense moods. This didn&#39;t really work. One day, in an intense bout of mania, Raffina seriously injured someone she had been angry at. This incident was very public, and her family had to finally admit she needed help. So they sent her to the institution.</p>
<p>Klug&#39;s family also didn&#39;t want to admit there was something off about him. He seemed to function just fine at first. But the way he acted with other people became more and more of an issue. He only really got along with Lemres, and is singularly obsessed with him. While not as public of an incident happened, his threats towards Feli and others made the town pressure his family to do something. So they sent him to the institution as a preemptive measure.</p>
<p>Accord is a relatively new worker at the institution, assigned to this group of five teens. She is a mix of optimistic and realist. She pushes for better treatment in the institution, wanting to go beyond simply keeping them in here forever. Though not many people take her that seriously, she still does her best with what she has. Her cat Popoi is a trained therapy cat. She brings him to the institution fairly often to help comfort the teens in times of stress.</p>
