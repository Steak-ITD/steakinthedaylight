                                        <p> This was drawn for me by <a href="https://x.com/heartlurch">Bird</a>. I asked for Ninjanyatchi being played with by disembodied hands, having her clothes torn and being scratched. <br> I wanted her specifically because she's a tamagotchi that you get if you make too many care mistakes (which is very easy to do), so I kind of translated that into intentional mistreatment. But like, why would you get such a COOL tamagotchi that way? Maybe she's a ninja because she had to learn to survive by herself? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>
