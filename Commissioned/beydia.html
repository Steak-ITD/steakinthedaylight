                                        <p> This was drawn for me by <a href="https://nitter.net/2n2nnh/media">Avvy</a>. I asked her to portray Relentless Beydia as a hermaphrodite, presenting itself and laying eggs.<br> Since every monster can breed with each other, I think of them all as hermaphroditic. I really liked Beydia's forms, they're all very different from each other, likely to represent its instability and glitchlike qualities, which are also shown in its eggs... this form though was my favorite. I like small, cute critters like this.</p></div>
