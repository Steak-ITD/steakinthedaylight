                                        <p> This was drawn for me by <a href="https://x.com/heartlurch">Whim</a>.

Being as curious as he is, Miles wants to do research into these feelings to understand them, and perhaps understand himself better as well.

So he "performs" experiments with himself, figuring out how he reacts to different stimulus both physically and mentally. Still being new to this kind of thing, the first times are quite overwhelming for him on both fronts, almost causing a panic, but ultimately resulting in a state of calmness and relief.</p></div>
