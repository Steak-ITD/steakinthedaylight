                                  <h5>Some things I remember about the decade, Oct 3, 2023</h5>
                                  <p>The 2000's to me are defined by being experimentally tacky. People were trying to figure out what the heck to do after the world did not end from Y2K. A lot of the toys and candy were kind of odd and niche. Like, those gogurt balls I think? Or the idog. They tried a lot of interactive toy stuff and virtual pets. The last part I wish I had more of. Also, movie tropes like fast and flashy camera editing, and general edginess and angst, which is also applicable to viseo games. Trying to be cool. It did not work. :P</p>
<p>Ooh and the internet played a big part. Lots of MMOs arose, some for kids, some for more general audiences. Every one I played has died :( I was a Club Penguin kid, and also really liked Pet Pet Park, and played the Ty Beanie Babies one. Some toys had features that let you do stuff online with codes, bringing your toy to life and such. Like Webkinz, which is STILL AROUND. And Beanie Babies as I mentioned.</p>
<p>I think of Windows XP a lot. Remember when it was a buggy mess like Windows ME? But they were actually able to fix it? Nice. What made it so special? The graphic and sound design is iconic, I feel. Nice round bevel borders for the windows, with a simple, invisible font. Web design was also still more experimental, but had a style of imitation 3d. They tried to make things seem like they have some dimension, with techniques like spotlights and the aforementioned bevels. More color variety too. The thing that keeps sticking in my mind is blue and gray contrasts, but I don't remember any site that used that. Hmm. One site I do remember was iCarly.com. Wave boarders, the green and blue color scheme, it still sticks in my mind after all these years despite it not being preserved very well...</p>
<p>Flash... what an invention. A lot of cartoons began using it. To what effect varies. Some were trying to see what its limits were, and what could be done over hand drawing (analog or digital). And others clearly were like "how cheap can we get away with". And of course it enabled soooo many people online. They figured out how to make full-fledged games with this thing, including RPG's and some of those MMO's I mentioned, which will always impress me.</p>
<p>There's probably more stuff I could mention, like the weird commercials that played on repeat that you remember by heart but couldn't care less about whatever they were selling. (Working for an hourly wage, I went to high school, didn't do great...) I would probably need some memory jogging though.</p>

  <h2><a id="Sonic x Tails Writeup">Sonic x Tails Writeup</a></h2>
  <h5>How I imagine their relationship. Used a template I can't find, Oct 3, 2023</h5>
  <p>Filling this out in text because Bored, I don't like *physically* Filling These Out, and I wanna elaborate more.</p>
<p>How it happens: Slowly for both of them. I imagine that they do have an immediate interest/connection with each other, so they try to get closer, and it happens very smoothly, perhaps not even realizing how much their bond grows over time, to the point they don't even think about it.</p>
<p>Showing affection: Sonic really likes building up Tails, and tells him how great and cool and special to him he is, which embarrasses Tails so much, but he's grateful for it. While Tails shows his affection more physically, I think he's kind of starved for... positive physical touches. But not like, head pats or things like that, he would be a hugger, cuddler. Something long and lasting leaving warmth behind.</p>
<p>Handling conflicts: I wouldn't say either of them would start arguments but neither are "laid-back" persay. There are definitely aspects of their personalities that clash. As an example, Sonic is way more impulsive than Tails. Prone to making quick decisions, which would definitely lead to some issues. They would both need space after getting into a fight to calm down and consider the issue and why the other is so upset.</p>
<p>Dealing with jealousy: Tails would deal with this more because of his insecurities. Worried about being replaced or abandoned because of someone better, or afraid he isn't living up to some perceived standard... though he knows deep down it's not a rational fear he can't help it sometimes! Sonic hardly gets jealous but when he does he probably won't pick up on it. Like seeing someone else petting *his* fox, he'd feel a twinge of possessiveness and cut in. And it's a little reassuring to Tails because it reminds him he is not so above it all. Sonic needs to have his space sometimes, while Tails is more needy for attention. Although he is trying to be better about this for both their sakes.</p>
<p>Relationship attitude: They are both very dedicated to each other, but are a bit reserved directly showing it around others. They are more directly affectionate while alone or in private. Others can see how strong their bond is by seeing how well they interact and synergize with each other.</p>
<p>Attachment: Tails has some separation anxiety again relating to his insecurities and fear, but seeks to be more independent. Learn not to worry so much, and figure himself out. Sonic does have a bit of separation anxiety too, but in a kind of different way in relation to his protectiveness. He takes it personally when someone hurts his partner in any way. He isn't used to Tails becoming more independent at first but he is happy and proud of him. He doesn't want to hold him back.</p>
<p>First to confess: Tails would ruminate a lot on how or what to say about how he feels, think about if it's the right moment or not, and wonder if he should even be direct or just show signs of his changing feelings... he would eventually, and that would give Sonic an excuse to admit his own feelings. He is a bit weird about admitting this sort of thing. Probably would be the kind of guy to just show signs rather than say anything.</p>
<p>First to apologize: This is hard to think about. I think it really depends on the argument. Perhaps they might do it at the same time after getting their space from each other to think things through.</p>
<p>More popular/charismatic: Well obviously Sonic! He just has that kind of charm, Tails is less outgoing in this respect.</p>
<p>Best sick caregiver: Tails would study whichever sickness Sonic gets as much as he could and pester him to take the steps to heal it properly. Sonic would have him do the basic things like drinking and eating enough, getting rest, etc.</p>
<p>Does the cooking: Sonic probably only knows how to make chili and hot dogs. But you can't *just* have this! So Tails would make some other things for them to eat...</p>
<p>Does housework: They could probably do this together. I think Tails finds busy work a comfort, and Sonic doesn't mind helping but is somewhat unfamiliar with it.</p>
<p>Does the speaking: Depends on the topic. Tails can speak at long length about something he knows or is interested in and sometimes tends to blurt things out accidentally. But Sonic is better with... conversations, and actually talking to others.</p>
<p>The overprotective one: As established in Attachment, Sonic is this; Tails doesn't feel a need to be most of the time.</p>
<p>Designated driver: Because of how reckless Sonic can be Tails insists on driving them when they use land vehicles. He's less picky about planes. Sonic will insist Tails steers any sea-based vehicles.</p>
<p>Penmanship: I have very little frame of reference for this ^^" I see no reason their penmanship would be noteworthy.</p>
<p>Relationship experience: I don't think either of them has much experience with that kind of relationship.</p>
<p>Sensitive to subtle changes: Sonic learns to pick up on Tails' mannerisms and movements that indicate his mood or thoughts. Sonic is not subtle so Tails has no trouble reading him most times.</p>
<p>Proposal: Since their relationship is reserved, they probably don't have much need for big gestures such as this, marriage, etc. I think they are content just existing together with the closeness they've gathered with each other over time.</p>
<p>The one who dies protecting the other: Both, but Sonic more.</p>
