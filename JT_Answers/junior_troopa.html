                    <p>An extremely short lived Tumblr ask blog I did. To the point that it may have zero presence online... UNTIL NOW</p>
                    <p>I only answered 4 questions and, of course, I don't have them anymore. So here are the pictures I drew, with as much context as I can remember. These are more than 5 years old so they don't reflect my art now.</p>

                                        <p>It's just titled "Tree" so I don't know what it was for. Possibly answering where he lives.</p>

                    <p>Describing how he will now be traversing water (he swims a VERY long distance over the ocean twice to follow Mario and co.)</p>

                    <p>Describing how he gets his tools and utilities.</p>

                    <p>These are all labeled with 3, so I'm guessing they were all in one post. I don't know what the first and third could have been but the second must have been about his favorite food, right?</p>

                    <p>I'm assuming this was just about if he can sing or not.</p>

                    <p>I don't know. Just him being arrogant.</p>
                    <p>One other answer I remember was him lamenting being alone practically his whole life. I don't remember the question. I didn't make a picture for that answer either.</div>
