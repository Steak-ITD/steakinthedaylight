<p>Cream came up with his name before sending him for adoption (creamy peanut butter pun). Peanut is raised in a foster home and doesn't know much about his birth parents. He doesn't find out about them until he becomes a young adult. He has a very average upbringing in a suburban home. His home was subject to attacks like any other place, and he has seenSonic in action a few times as a result. He grows looking up to Sonic, unknowing of their relationship.</p><p>He is better with books than the street, and he is aware of this. He's moderatly proud of how intelligent he is but is socially shy. He doesn't keep up with, and is somewhat disillusioned by,  trends in terms of fashion or speech, so he sounds old fashioned to some. He does better in school when talking about the subjects he learns about. His favorite subjects are about home education. He is a fantastic chef and smoothie maker and it later becomes his profession.</p><p>He enjoys sports, especially those involving speed like running and swimming. He eats a lot of healthy food and meals, loving to work with fruits and vegetables. He thinks of these passions as an alternative way to communicate with people.</p><p>He thinks travelling would be wonderful as he would get to experience and learn about different meals around the world. Maybe even compete in their sports too. He looks up to Sonic because of how much he travels and sees. He also loves his incredible speed and strives to match it someday.</p><p>He wears both sports gear and cooking apparel, even if they clash. The colors are usually purple and white to go with his quills. Otherwise he doesn't wear any extra clothing or accessories, finding them a little cumbersome.</p><p>He is very meek and apologetic to others when he makes a mistake, not wanting to cause any trouble or make a scene. Public humiliation is one of his biggest fears, so he makes sure he is always prepared for anything he has to do that would be made public. He makes sure he is very meticulous with his preparation for cooking and that he follows every step precisely. He daydreams about new recipies and food he can make. Learning new cooking methods is very exciting for him.</p><p>He is not a very humorous person, and doesn't understand current jokes or memes or what is supposed to be humorous about them. He prefers simple, physical humor to speech humor or referential humor.</p><p>He has a conflicting need of wanting to live a peaceful life not bothering anyone while also indulging in hobbies that directly involve others. He sometimes is willing to sacrifice his own well being if it means getting on or staying on someone's good side, because deep down he is afraid of what might happen to him otherwise. He thinks first about things before acting, and has trained himself to think very quickly for his hobbies.</p><p>He is tall and limber. He doesn't weight very much and so is easy to lift and carry. He is proud of how he has maintained his body but doesn't go out of his way to impress others with it. His voice is medium high and he stutters when nervous. His prevailing facial expressions are a cheerful smile and a focused glare.</p>
