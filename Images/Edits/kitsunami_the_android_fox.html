    <p>A version of Kit for my classic universe. This one is a hydrolic android who's true name is Wave Unit 21. He comes from Little Planet's good future. He knows almost nothing about his past or what he was made for. He choses to follow Surge as he loved the philosophy she lives by. He is a force to be reckoned with; not easy to convince, cold, and a bit coniving and insidious. He's also polite, respectful, and loyal to a fault. He will repay any debt he feels he's owed.</p>
    <p>Being so light he can swim pretty fast with a freestyle or breaststroke. He can breath underwater (also a potential game mechanic). He makes water for himself by absorbing molecules in the air into his pack, and then he can shape the water into some form, usually tails, sometimes hands, or spears. The water is typically cold but gets hotter with his emotion, or it can become ice or steam. Freshwater is preferred mainly due to taste. ( I don't know if saltwater is much different from freshwater otherwise) His body feels constantly wet.</p>
    <p>Theoretical game mechanics:
        Kit cannot roll into a ball at all. He can briefly fly with his hydropack and attack with a hydro tail. In his hyper form he can make a tsunami if near a large enough body of water. Extra emerald power lets him pound the ground releasing icicles from where he lands.
