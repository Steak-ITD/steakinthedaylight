  <p>A version of Kitsunami the Fennec for my classic Sonic universe.
  </p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>He is a hydrolic android who's true name is Wave Unit 21. He comes from Little Planet's good future, invented to test hydraulic/hydroelectric technology. He knows almost nothing about his past or what he was made for at first.  He is a force to be reckoned with; not easy to convince, cold, and a bit coniving and insidious. He's also polite, respectful, and loyal to a fault. He will repay any debt he feels he's owed.</p>
<p>He makes water for himself by absorbing molecules in the air into his pack, and then he can shape the water into some form, usually tails, sometimes hands, or spears. The water is typically cold but gets hotter with his emotion, or it can become ice or steam. Freshwater is preferred mainly due to taste.</p>

  <h2>Relationships</h2>
  <p>He choses to follow Surge as he loved the philosophy she lives by. They are very loyal to each other, even if they argue sometimes.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <h5>Facial features:</h5>
<p>His hair covers his face. His eyes are a bright purple-magenta.</p>
          <p><h5>Hair:</h5>
<p>Blue fur with a white belly, inner ears, and tail tip.</p>
          <p><h5>Body:</h5>
<p>Quite short and a little chubby. he also feels wet to the touch.</p>

  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <h5>Hobbies:</h5>
  <p>Being so light he can swim pretty fast with a freestyle or breaststroke.</p>
  
  <h5>Favorite Food:</h5>
  <p>Doesn't eat food. Prefers freshwater.</p>

  <h5>Voice:</h5>
  <p>TBD</a>
<p>  
    <h5>Other:</h5>
    <p>Theoretical game mechanics: Kit cannot roll into a ball at all. He can breath underwater. He can briefly fly with his hydropack and attack with a hydro tail. In his hyper form he can make a tsunami if near a large enough body of water. Extra emerald power lets him pound the ground releasing icicles from where he lands.</p>
    <p>Design basis: Concept art, as well as punk aesthetics.</p>
