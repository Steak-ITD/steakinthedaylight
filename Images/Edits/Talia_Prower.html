<li>Gets very excited about things she loves, has trouble focusing on other things, unless it relates to Crem</li>

</ul>
<p>She was a lonely girl, rejected by her peers for her odd behavior. She tries to reconcile her anxiety by pretending it isn't there and going into something as if she has no fear.</p>
<p>She is book-smart about motors and vehicles, knows a bit about geography for the sake of terrain knowledge, and knows how to use power tools. She's aware of how smart she is with these things, and though generally intelligent as well, she doesn't see herself as that smart or passionate about things outside engineering. She can speak at length about the topics she likes but gets clammy about things she doesn't know as much about.</p>
<p>She would succeed in school due to her intelligence, though have a slight struggle due to her hyper fixes not lining up with the subjects. She would join a robotics or chess club. Occasionally she may tune into sports.</p>
<p>Her career is in automotive repair. She wishes she could do more with boats or planes as well, but not many in her area use these devices. She also would like to branch out to trains. She travels to places that she thinks would make good skydiving areas. This is how she learned skydiving near mountains is a bad idea. So she does it toward ocean views and beaches. She improves her tail gliding during her travels.</p>
<p>She is disillusioned with most people due to the bullying from her youth. Though she still tries to be nice to others and make friends. She's not hopeless about this. She got along well with Crem. They are both autistic and they found that their interests could coincide even though they aren't inherently similar. She creates machines and he makes them look nice.</p>
<p>She is anxious about being touched, so sex is weird for her. She has only ever done it with Crem.</p>
<p>Her workplace is neat and tidy for the sake of safety and organization. Her other rooms are also tidy, though sometimes things involving her hobbies like magazines are lying around. She likes to wear this sports shirt because it reminds her of a particularly exhilarating skydiving session. She wears her hair in a ponytail because of the tendency to do so while working, again for safety. Her tail is often off the ground as well.</p>
<p>Sometimes she can let her pride get the best of her. When this fails, it reveals her anxious scared side. When she absolutely does not know something, she freezes and is unable to speak. She wants to forgive the people who hurt her in the past if only for her own mental sake, but it isn't easy because she hasn't seen most of them in years, and the effect they had on her is still felt.</p>
<p>She doesn't take her own personal failures very hard, simply deciding to use them to make her projects better. Failures involving others are harder to cope with. She doesn't like to cause inconvenience for others. She is willing to learn new things, even if she isn't very interested in the subject (unless it would help Crem). She has an active imagination when it comes to figuring out what vehicles and robots can do.</p>
<p>She enjoys comedic mishaps, even when it happens with her inventions, she can have a good laugh about her own mistakes and fix them. She knows she isn't as prideful or confident as she lets on, and she knows her past still affects her. Being with Crem helps her move on for a time.</p>
<p>She doesn't have a specific life goal, simply enjoying making her imagination into reality. She continues to challenge herself regarding her inventions. She is in between thoughts first and actions first.</p>
<p>She likes that she's short. She believes it makes it easier to work and fit into small spaces. It also makes it easier to blend into a crowd if she needs to. She moves pretty fast gesturally. She can use her tail as a limb to hold extra things. They're strong enough to grab hands. Her voice is about medium-high. She usually has a cheerful face on, seeming to glow in solid sunlight likely due to her yellow fur.</p>
