                                        <p>He lived under a strict discipline of how a demon should and shouldn't act. He wasn't fond of being hidden forever as a ghost, or simply haunting others without any other interaction. He left his old "haunt" and became a rouge demon. He was met with rejection from his peers for this, but he didn't care about this much, since there were other demons who had left their groups behind, he was sure they would understand his reasoning. Sure enough, they do, and they generally accept him, and leave him on his way.</p>
<p>He is a curious fellow, seeking to learn new things about his environment. He doesn't see himself as smart yet, due to having lived in a small place for so long. His speech is a bit slow, and he mispronounces words often.</p>
<p>He has an interest in reading, particularly geography books and fantasies. He can't see many places since he can't manifest in white light (sunlight) and fades in other strong lights. His imagination is very vivid, so this is his substitution for traveling. He also likes searching for photos of the daytime. He can take night photography.</p>
<p>He's very polite to others, at first. He can be frightening otherwise, as a demon ghost. He can manifest more worms from the ground, and extend the ones from his ears, to attack others.</p>
<p>He is also curious about sex and is willing to try most things, even that which would be dangerous to corporeal beings because he is a ghost demon. He finds sex to be fun, and prefers to be on top and dominant but is ok with switching. They attend meet-ups with other rouge ghosts, sometimes to exchange gifts and found possessions.</p>
<p>His home is in a clearing in a shrouded forest. He lives in a small shed, which he has kept mostly tidy, besides the dust and spiders. His books and photos are all organized. He doesn't wear clothes, but his fur is usually well-kempt and his worms are clean and calm.</p>
<p>He can get defensive rather quickly if he feels afraid or is stressed. His worms are an extension of himself so they reflect how he's feeling with about 85% accuracy. Also, his curiosity can lead him to danger sometimes. He appears self-righteous to ghosts that still live within groups and follow those rules.</p>
<p>He has the inclination to scare others as a part of being both a ghost and a demon, and he enjoys doing so. He is unlikely to actually hurt someone unless they are antagonizing him. In terms of sex, he likes to be the one causing "suffering" so to speak. One feeling he cannot take is the feeling of sunlight.</p>
<p>Despite this, he daydreams a lot about places he wishes he could go visit but can't due to having high amounts of light, such as cities or certain landscapes. They are optimistic about discovering new things and will try to at least travel a little to places that he can tolerate, such as Halloween mazes or haunted house attractions.</p>
<p>He mocks his kind's tendencies to stay hidden from corporeal beings, thinking some issues could easily be solved by not being hidden at all. Though he knows they aren't going to listen to his reasonings. Shocking humor is one of his favorites, and he enjoys making darker jokes if he isn't feeling well.</p>
<p>Compulsively, he has a need to frighten corporeal beings once in a while. He is also inclined to avoid strong light. Candlelight is an exception, no matter how hot it is. It is the only heat he gravitates towards, otherwise, he moves toward cold areas. He pursues his passions to the best of his abilities as a ghost demon, being aware of his limitations in this regard.</p>
<p>He is of medium height, weightless as a ghost, and has little physicality. He has to concentrate in order to hold earthly objects like his books. Since he reads so much, it's now something he can do without thinking about it too much. His posture is pretty straight. He gestures and speaks relatively slowly. his voice is deep and smooth. His face is usually in a neutral or neutral frown position or a forboding type of smile.</p>.</div>
