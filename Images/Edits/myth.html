  <p>Myth is a mysterious Sphinx living somewhere remote on the planet.
<p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Myth seems to be half dead both in demeanor and body composition. The first half of his body looks to be somewhat decayed, while the second is epherial and defies logic. He is apparently revered as some sort of Godlike figure on the planet, despite very few ever seeing him or knowing about his condition. He may have been a failed experiment from the creator of the Sphinxes, but his purpose is unknown, of course.

  <h2>Relationships</h2>
  <p>Probably has the most relations with the other Sphinxes on his remote island, who worship him due to his mysterious nature. He doesn't seem to mind that much but isn't seeking them out either.

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <h5>Complexion:</h5>
<p>His skin feels sticky and a bit thin, like it would be easy to tear. It seems to be rotting.</p>
        
        <h5>Facial features:</h5>
<p>His eyes are red and always squinted.</p>
          <p><h5>Hair:</h5>
<p>He has orange hair on his head, and his lower body is made of white shiny feathers.</p>
          <p><h5>Body:</h5>
<p>He is tall and lanky. he wears a short yellow vest.</p>
