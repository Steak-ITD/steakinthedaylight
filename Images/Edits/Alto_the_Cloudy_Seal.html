    <p>Alto is a seal living a fairly average life as a lazy mattress saleswoman.

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Alto is a fearful and anxious seal who would rather spend her time relaxing or sleeping than doing anything dangerous. She is smart enough to run her own business as a mattress saleswoman. She likes to think of herself as educated in business. She is outwardly polite to everyone she meets and speaks in a formal manner to most people, referring to them with a prefix. She is also smart enough to have passed school with good grades. She would have been in a book or cooking club.</p>
<p>Despite her perceived intelligence, she has a streak of laziness and sleeps fairly often. This is probably what attracted her to the idea of selling mattresses. If it is late at night, one might catch her sleeping on one of her beds.</p>
<p>She doesn't like to travel and is perfectly content staying in her one little shop. The few times she has moved haven't been very pleasant for her as she couldn't get used to the areas. She likes to be in places that have moisture and/or humidity like beaches or jungles. She doesn't do very well in cities or deserts and dislikes high altitudes.</p>
<p>She is also apparently able to hold a grudge, usually, if someone ruins something of hers like the beds she is selling, she will remember it for a decently long time. Even still, she is not very confrontational and is evasive in stressful situations. She may hide or find some way to defend herself as if being attacked, even when the situation probably wouldn't call for it. She panics heavily towards her own mistakes and gets angry towards others mistakes. She believes in karmic retribution, so if she sees someone who wronged her get comeuppance, she is generally happy with this.</p>
<p>Most of her imagination comes with her dreaming as she is asleep. She thinks she's too busy during the day for daydreaming. She is skittish and worried many times about things going wrong (the thing she keeps herself busy with). She appreciates sleeping because it allows her to feel safe for a few hours. She is not very enthusiastic about new things happening or changes in her routine, but she eventually gets used to it... until it changes again.</p>
<p>Property damage is something she really hates and has great scorn for anyone who would do it, even by accident. Sometimes she might get on someone for laziness, before catching herself and realizing she can't be one to talk about it. She doesn't have a sense of humor but recognizes when someone is making a joke and politely laughs along.</p>
<p>She mostly just wants a simple and consistent life with little surprise or change, practically doing the same thing every day. She views her life very much like a schedule in her head, a list of everything to do in one day or one week, with no room to fit in other things, other than a few naps. Her laziness gets in the way sometimes but generally, she can get everything done in a day with just a *few* shifts in scheduling.</p>

    <h4>Appearance</h4>
        <h5>Facial features</h5>
<p>Large purple-pink eyes and a squishy face. She is usually seen with a neutral smile and speaks with larger words. She can also appear nervous or frightened when stressed.</p>
          <p><h5>Hair</h5>
<p>Light blue and white fur with markings resembling clouds.</p>
          <p><h5>Body</h5>
<p>She is a tall, thin woman with a straight posture. She projects the image of a worker and a tidy person. Her gestures are small and contained.

<h2>Trivia</h2>
  <h4>Hobbies</h4>
<p>She still attends book clubs and cooking classes. Her favorite foods to make are quiches and macaroons. Mainly things that are filled with other things, like stuffed chicken breasts. She happily brings her food to her book club. She also got into sewing recently to make her own beds.</p>
<p>As a result, her room is full of feathers, thread, and some needles. Her kitchen is messy and dishes often take some time to get done. The rest of her home is a little better, but the thread can be seen strewn about. She keeps her clothing tidy, is well-dressed, and is clean. Her appearance matches her attitude more than her home does. She wouldn't admit it but she is kind of lazy and takes a while to do certain things, like cleaning her home. She also sleeps a lot and prefers to live in her dreams.</p>
  <h4>Favorite Food</h4>
  <p>Foods with fillings, like cream puffs and stuffed chicken.</p>
