                    <p>Marble is a hybrid of a jerboa and a gecko. Its colors are based on sunsets.<p>
                                        <p>Its demeanor is curious but timid. Very much a flight or fighter. Reacts very positively to being treated kindly and very poorly to being threatened. And it has a good memory, so it will keep in mind who did what. Very affectionate once you get to know it. It smiles by showing a lot of teeth. Attacks with their claws and feet, and can screech very loudly. It likes to eat beetles, those brown bugs with green blood are its favorite food.</p>
<p>It has rodent-like hemipenes. It masturbates frequently to calm down. Could use the tip of its tail to do so, or hump soft surfaces or objects, like sand. It prefers bottoming; it would like having its hemipenes stimulated directly, by hand(or equivalent), or mouth.</p>
