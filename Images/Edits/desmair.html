  <p>Desmair is an eccentric magical dead unicorn.
<p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Desmair is a zombie pony that is countless years old, yet still acts somewhat like a bratty child. It thinks mainly on instincts and gets very frustrated if its in a state it doesn't like. It's very fussy about weather and only wants to be in cold temperatures and wet areas. Its movements are erratic and sudden.<p>
                                        <p>Its horn is functional and is mainly used for levitation of itself or other objects. It takes great pride in how it looks and of course gets fusst about being dirty or too wet. It is concerned about falling apart as it is not physically strong and is slightly rotting.</p>

  <h2>Relationships</h2>
  <p>It has a weird relationship with <a href="/Images/Edits/berricol.html">Berricol</a>. Desmair seems to be both fascinated and frazzled by Berricol's existence, touching its body repeatedly in ways most would find invasive. Berricol doesn't care that much, and this frustrates Desmair even more...</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <h5>Facial features:</h5>
<p>Eyes have black sclera and red pupils, a short snout, and a black horn on its forehead.</p>
          <p><h5>Hair:</h5>
<p>Green fur that feels very close to falling off, but never does. Its mane and tail are an off white.</p>
          <p><h5>Body:</h5>
<p>Suprisingly has some fat on it, but otherwise short and stubby looking.</p>
