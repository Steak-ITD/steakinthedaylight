<p>Crem had a calm but somewhat uptight upbringing, so he is a little shy. Despite that, he is a curious fellow. He is just a bit nervous about asking questions, as he doesn't want to be seen as a nuisance. He also gets clammy when asked something himself. This is because he doesn't usually get much attention from others, so isn't used to it when it happens. Slowly he becomes more comfortable asking and receiving questions from others.</p>
<p>He is not very street-smart or socially aware. He doesn't express himself visibly very well. He is smart about the subject of artwork creation, such as what kinds of tools to use and when for who. His vocabulary reflects this as he is well-versed in this area. However, he struggles with more absolute subjects such as math or chemistry. He prefers the spontaneity of things like artwork or even sports.</p>
<p>He works together with Talia in her workshop. He does the decoration for the mechanical vehicles she creates. They both split the costs and the earnings. He is content doing what he does.</p>
<p>He is very polite to everyone, usually referring to them by their surname and a prefix unless they say it's ok to do otherwise. Talia is the only one he refers to with no prefix. They get along due to their similar fixations on their interests, and he can relate to her social trouble and obfuscation of emotion.</p>
<p>The one vehicle he really enjoys using is a plane, specifically smaller ones. He is usually wearing an aviator suit with a hat and goggles, and no pants. Sometimes they are covered in paint or graphite stains.</p>
<p>He is pretty shy and especially meek around new people. He doesn't like to cause any trouble so if he has negative impressions about someone, he will keep it to himself. Rarely does he get visibly or even audibly angry. Occasionally he may make a snide remark if he is upset with how someone else is acting toward him or Talia. (She likes when he does this.) He is curious about a lot of things even if they aren't his main interest, but is often shy about asking, so he might try to figure it out himself by action. He is not kind towards arrogance and it is the one thing that bothers him about Talia sometimes.</p>
<p>His sense of humor is a bit confusing. He doesn't pick up on jokes very quickly. He likes puns most because they are simpler to understand. He doesn't have much sense of humor about himself but is aware of who he is. He doesn't take being laughed at very well, and anyone is unlikely to be in a situation where they are laughing with him.</p>
<p>He doesn't want much in life, other than to be able to stand up for himself. He likes his job and would like to keep doing it forever, even if it stops making him money. Drawing on paper is like a stim for him so he does it a lot. He also plays with his ears. Sometimes he rubs them as if brushing, sometimes he squeezes the tips. Staring at the moving clouds in the sky also keeps him calm.</p>
<p>He spends a lot of time thinking. He does it slowly as he wants to understand everything before making action. He is about medium tall, with a lithe body, and stands straight. He has no issues with his physicality. he can fly with his ears for a very short time. Secretly he wishes he could do it longer, but is content with flying planes for now.</p>
<p>His gestures are medium slow, particularly when painting, but he is able to move very fast for drawing moving subjects like birds or marathon runners. His ability to draw so fast has led him to be described as a living camera. He is best at capturing singular subjects.</p>
<p>He doesn't express his emotions with his face most of the time. He wears a neutral smile most times, thinking that's one way to get people to not be too hard on him. When he is expressing himself facially, he has a strong feeling about something.</p>
