  <p>Crem is an autistic rabbit painter.
<p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Crem had a calm but somewhat uptight upbringing, so he is a little shy. Despite that, he is a curious fellow. He is just a bit nervous about asking questions, as he doesn't want to be seen as a nuisance. He also gets clammy when asked something himself. This is because he doesn't usually get much attention from others, so isn't used to it when it happens. Slowly he becomes more comfortable asking and receiving questions from others. He doesn't like to cause any trouble so if he has negative impressions about someone, he will keep it to himself. Rarely does he get visibly or even audibly angry. Occasionally he may make a snide remark if he is upset with how someone else is acting toward him or Talia. (She likes when he does this.) He is not kind towards arrogance and it is the one thing that bothers him about Talia sometimes.</p>
<p>He is not very street-smart or socially aware. He doesn't express himself visibly very well. He is smart about the subject of artwork creation, such as what kinds of tools to use and when for who. His vocabulary reflects this as he is well-versed in this area. However, he struggles with more absolute subjects such as math or chemistry. He prefers the spontaneity of things like artwork or even sports.</p>
<p>He works together with Talia in her workshop. He does the decoration for the mechanical vehicles she creates. They both split the costs and the earnings. He is content doing what he does.</p>
<p>He spends a lot of time thinking. He does it slowly as he wants to understand everything before making action. He is about medium tall, with a lithe body, and stands straight. He has no issues with his physicality. He can fly with his ears for a very short time. Secretly he wishes he could do it longer, but is content with flying planes for now.</p>
<p>His gestures are medium slow, particularly when painting, but he is able to move very fast for drawing moving subjects like birds or marathon runners. His ability to draw so fast has led him to be described as a living camera. He is best at capturing singular subjects.</p>
<p>He doesn't express his emotions with his face most of the time. He wears a neutral smile most times, thinking that's one way to get people to not be too hard on him. When he is expressing himself facially, he has a strong feeling about something.</p>
  <h2>Relationships</h2>
  <p>Talia is his girlfriend and is the only one he refers to with no prefix. They get along due to their similar fixations on their interests, and he can relate to her social trouble and obfuscation of emotion.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <h5>Facial features:</h5>
<p>Orange like his face, with a white muzzle and orange eyes.</p>
          <p><h5>Hair:</h5>
<p>Light orange fur with darker orange accents on the ears.</p>
          <p><h5>Body:</h5>
<p>He is usually wearing an aviator suit with a hat and goggles, and no pants. Sometimes they are covered in paint or graphite stains.</p>

  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <h5>Hobbies:</h5>
  <p>Drawing on paper is like a stim for him so he does it a lot. He also plays with his ears. Sometimes he rubs them as if brushing, sometimes he squeezes the tips. Staring at the moving clouds in the sky also keeps him calm.</p>
  
  <h5>Favorite Food:</h5>
  <p>Not particularly interested in any food.</p>

  <h5>Voice:</h5>
  <p>TBD</a>
<p>  
    <h5>Other:</h5>
    <p>When I adopted him his design was based on and alternate "Prime" Cream the Rabbit. He probably lives in an alternate universe to her.</p>
