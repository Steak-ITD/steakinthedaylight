                                        <p> My interpretation/Au/OC of the demon in Klug's book's original form and personality. </p>
                                        <p>Despite being an overlord, he is very introverted and reclusive. He's generally polite to others and empathetic to their plights. But he feels more at home with plants and animals, and knows a decent amount about them. They love to read and share what they learn, and sometimes people come to them for their knowledge. They value their freedom. He tries not to get worked up or agitated as it affects his immense magical power, but he is still feared for it. He uses blue, red and dark magic, and studies it often.
                                            They live in a dimly lit home with red and purple walls and furniture, with plants strewn about. They have a large library, which they are very proud about.</p>
                                            <p>Also I do see him as autistic, since that's how I see Sig. I think their many years made them understand how to handle it. For example, living in a dimly lit, far off home because they're sensitive to light and loud noise.</p>
                                            <p>I decided he would be an nb male because, I think the whole concept of gender and gender standards would seem nebulous, random to him, no matter how much he studies it. And it isn't something he thinks about in his day to day life, presentation to others, because he's not around humans or demons often enough to care, and humans are scared of him regardless, so... What really, is gender doing for him? But also, he doesn't completely 100% relate to "non binary"(even then they would describe that feeling more as "null"), there is still a part of him that he would identify as being "male" internally. It is confusing, intangible, but it's there anyway and he feels it. A biological feeling maybe, an instinct, he's not sure.</p>
                                            <p>I'd still ship him wth Klug, in this reality where he was never split... 

                                                Lemres would tell Klug about the mysterious and powerful demon, who lives by themself in a mansion. Klug seeks power and knowledge, so he'd go to see them and ask they take him up as a tutor. Of course the demon would say no, and of course Klug won't take no for an answer. 
                                                
                                                Intriguingly, this determined boy doesn't seem to fear his appearance or his powers. Bit by bit, he relents. What's the harm in sharing knowledge? They both have a love of studying, and they experiment with each others magic, learning more and more about it, and each other.
                                                
                                                Even though they have different life goals, they end up getting along in a kind of teasing-mentor rash-student way. But they also challenge each other, keeping them sharp and on their toes. There's a theme of trust, where previously both of them had trouble doing so with others, they find it's easier with each other.</p>
                                                <p>Hypothetically if Sig and Crimson ever met they'd be super uncomfortable with each other. Sig has this vague recognition of the demon and his magic and it freaks him out how similar they are to him. 

                                                  And Crimson knows exactly what Sig is and is kind of, betrayed by the idea of being trapped like that. But also intrigued that the "good" half developed a personality. And it's conflicting because as far as anyone knows being whole again would kill that personality. Doesn't he have a right to exist too? Does that override the demon's right to exist? Hard questions that give them a headache...</p>
