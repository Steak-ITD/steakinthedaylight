    <p>A version of Surge for my classic universe. She was created as a weapon for some mysterious purpose that she can't remember very well, but she wants to continue living her life without the past weighing her down. As a result of her modifications she has the power to control electricity. Unfortunately her mind was altered as well, causing her to be angrier and more one track minded than she was before, making her more unstable and violent. But she was always headstrong and confident in herself.</p>
    <p>Theoretical game mechanics:
    Surge can roll into a ball and spin dash, she can also air dash like Charmy can. Her super/ hyper form releases sparks when she air dashes. In hyper form she can cause thunderstorms.</p>
