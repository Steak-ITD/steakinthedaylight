<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Her "creators" used similar technology to Eggman, where they use biological energy to power machinery. But the machinery is implanted into her, making her a cyborg. She was created as a weapon for some mysterious purpose that she can't remember very well, but she wants to continue living her life without the past weighing her down. As a result of her modifications she has the power to control electricity. Unfortunately her mind was altered as well, causing her to be angrier and more one track minded than she was before, making her more unstable and violent. But she was always headstrong and confident in herself.</p>
