                                        <p>Xilliai is a bug demigod. It has six eyes, each with perfect vision, allowing 360 views. It can teleport anywhere it can see, and using this ability can travel very fast along the ground. Since it is a powerful demigod and realmbreaker, it has no sense of self-preservation, doing as it pleases and barely noticing injuries, which simply heal almost as fast as they happen. However, it is also apathetic to any effects it has on the environment, such as potentially attracting other bugs or even predators to areas they don't belong to. It spends its days eating exotic leaves.</p>.</div>
