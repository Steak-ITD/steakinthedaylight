</ul>
<p>Poly can't help but feel intimidated by her dad sometimes. But she knows he is kind and doesn't want to hurt her. He teaches her how to defend herself from enemies. She likes to think he has made her appear tougher. Her mom showers her with love all the time, and it makes her feel a bit embarrassed getting so much attention from her. They study the occult together. Together with her parents she feels protected from danger. She tries not to be nervous when she is alone because she can use what she learns from them to stay safe.</p> 
<p>Her upbringing is generally average. She is allowed to go off and do her own thing provided they feel like she is prepared enough. Amy wants to spoil her sometimes and Bark usually reigns this in. They struggle with money so many of the possessions they have are directly from nature, such as stone collections.</p>
<p>Poly doesn't see herself as very smart and can get discouraged when she doesn't know something she thinks everyone else around her does. She does know about geography and is observant of the land around her. She can speak fine for the most part, though sometimes she needs to be told to speak up. Sometimes she just doesn't want to speak at all, like her dad.</p>
<p>She gets involved in hand sports like baseball and basketball. She seems to like the shape of spheres in general, and the sounds of a basketball dribbling or the smack of a bat. That's why she has one as a weapon. Balls also remind her of rocks sometimes, with their smooth texture and roundness. She studies lithomancy and has her own board and stones for making predictions.</p>
<p>To use her interest in geography for a job, she becomes a geospatial analyst, documenting the changes in terrain between each zone. She has also dabbled in creating maps, as a way to document such changes. On the side, she will offer her lithomancy practice to others. Besides this, she writes her findings in a travel writing style. She likes cold areas the most but doesn't mind warmer areas as long as she takes off her sweater. She enjoys rocky or mountainous zones like Hill Top and Mystic Cave.</p>
<p>She struggles with confidence issues and sometimes, her interest in her hobbies and her life. (Seems to be a chemical imbalance) This is something that is omnipresent in her moods. She undersells her own abilities because of this, not thinking she is as good at what she does as she actually is.</p>
<p>She is more affectionate to others than to herself. She would like someone she can shower in compliments and gifts. She is very empathetic and can find ways to relate to other's struggles. This helps her when making predictions as she can help calm someone down if they get one they perceive as bad or troubling. In groups, she doesn't stand out but doesn't blend in perfectly either. She does try to blend in sometimes, but as a result of her depression, she thinks it might not be best for her to be in focus, or tells herself she shouldn't take focus away from someone else.</p>
<p>Her room is neat and has a color scheme similar to her clothing: pink, white, and cyan. She enjoys light high-value schemes, but also separately enjoys darker, saturated colors. She can be a bit stingy about mixing them together if not done in a certain &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; way.</p>
<p>She wears sweaters that are just slightly too big for her, and the sleeves cover her hands. She thinks it looks cute on her. The patterns contain other things she likes like hearts and polka dots. She has an emotive hat that looks like a slime creature (puyo).</p>
<p>Since she gets attached easily, being hurt or betrayed can be devastating for her. She will put the blame on herself somehow, even if it isn't entirely or at all her fault. She freezes or dissociates in stressful situations and can't fight or flee right away, which can cause things to escalate. She herself is not a revengeful person but will become more distant from most people over time as a defense mechanism. She ends up taking medicine for her depression eventually.</p>
<p>Sometimes in her dissociation, she can project her spirit outside of her body. She isn't sure how to do this regularly except outside of sleeping; it doesn't happen while daydreaming. The things she sees in this state are abstract and hard to describe. The colors and movements of the world become strangely smooth as if everything around is dizzy. She sees colors and lights she can't imagine properly.</p>
<p>She enjoys traveling to new places and learning about the geographical history and terrain of the land. She does not think she is as good as she actually is, sometimes doesn't think she is deserving of happiness or anything, and thinks she is better at doing things for others' sake than herself. She wants to be more confident like her parents, but it is just something she can't help but struggle with.</p>
<p>She also tries to map out the things she sees in her astral projections. It's not exactly a secret since she would tell someone if they asked, but she doesn't outwardly talk about it without prompting. She is passionate about her interests like her mother but doesn't always feel the need to express this outwardly. She thinks first before acting, but in a stressful situation has trouble getting to the next thought while one repeats in her mind.</p>
<p>She becomes taller than her mother within a short time, but never as large as her father. She doesn't mind being nude but is usually wearing warm clothing like sweaters, jeans, and socks. her voice is pretty high, but she speaks quietly, becoming lower and lower as she finishes a sentence or thought. She is pretty expressive. She doesn't hide positive feelings and will usually let negative emotions show through if asked enough.</p>
