    <p>She has been lonely for a long time and as a result is friendly to a fault, ready to welcome anyone needing escape from their former homes and retreating from destroyed planets. She has also been rumored to be rather promiscuous, though some say it's another result of her loneliness and desire to not be the last of her species anymore.</p>
