                                        <p>Floral Fae is a cross between a jumping spider and a poodle moth. She's a benevolent spirit with a spicy side. She'd been looking for a new home after her own had been ruined by a red giant star. She's the one who created the alien sanctuary on the Planet. </p>
                                        <p>She has been lonely for a long time and as a result is friendly to a fault, ready to welcome anyone needing escape from their former homes and retreating from destroyed planets. She has also been rumored to be rather promiscuous, though some say it's another result of her loneliness and desire to not be the last of her species anymore.</p>
