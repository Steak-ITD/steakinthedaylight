                                        <p> I'm borrowing a Cream concept design. No one is using them, eh? So I am about to do the most self indulgent nonsense. I will call her Brie the Hare. Her Chao is Snuffy, a Normal Chaos Chao. So we got a pair who get up to some less than savory antics with other characters.</p>

<p>Brie has an odd fascination with other animals' insides, and a complex about tearing them open and apart. While Snuffy is a violent toad that likes to cause pain to others. They both don't talk much and are dissonant towards others. Often seen smiling as they silently think about their next actions. How will they satiate their compulsion today?</p>

<p>Brie and Snuffy do what they do cause it just makes them happy. They aren't like, anti-establishment or anything like that. They just chase their own pleasure without a care in the world. Like, a psychotic lack of care for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Brie could be a sociopath since I imagine her barely being aware of the pain she causes to others and only being in her own mind, thinking about how what she's doing is affecting her alone. Snuffy is probably just a bastard that knows what it's doing is wrong and doesn't care. It only cares about Brie and doesn't want her to get hurt. Everything else is fair game, and it enjoys seeing others in pain.</p>
<p>Sometimes when Brie is bored she starts messing with her own body. Pulling off fur and skin, cutting her arms open with sharp objects, even using a bat to cause blunt force trauma. Snuffy doesn't like when she does this so it might go outside to find some small animal for her to mess with instead. If it's really desperate it will let her hurt it. She is self aware enough not to do anything that would directly kill herself like stabbing vital organs, and she doesn't do anything with her own eyes, but otherwise she is pretty reckless with herself.</p>
