<p>Gareth feels mixed about his parents. He was raised mainly by his mother Honey, who while busy with her career did care for him as best she could. Although he's off-put by her self-centeredness. She has taught him how to knit and sew, which he has taken with him for life (he made his own clothes). He doesn't like his father very much, mainly his cowardice. But begrudgingly he admits his smarts and tech are enviable. He is motivated to be better than his father any way he can as is a bit insecure about looking like him. His discipline was fairly lenient but is enough to know how to act appropriately in most situations. He was more sheltered as a kid, staying at home while his mom worked, but became more independent as he grew older.</p>
<p>He is more street smart than book smart but doesn't think much of it and sees himself as of average intelligence. His speech is short and blunt with the occasional longer word thrown in. He's very quick with mathematical equations. He could have been in a math or chess club in school. He shares a love of shiny things with his dad, so he also hunts for treasure, with a preference for silver. He also likes sharp objects and weapons. His main weapon is a pair of butterfly knives. He's impressed by Poly's use of a steel bat.<br />His mood can shift on a dime and he is particularly quick to anger when something doesn't go his way. He is on edge around others due to past experiences and being seen as suspicious.</p>
<p>He hunts for treasure like his father and occasionally hunts bounties. He prefers to travel alone, mainly picking up metallic items. He often travels to isolated, far-off places like caves, jungles, and deserts. He prefers to travel at night so he can watch the stars and use them for direction.</p>
<p>With Poly, whom he can relax around. They feel like they never have to act differently when they're together. They share their collections of rocks and knives, learn to fight together, and spend long periods of time quietly close. Gareth takes Poly's predictions seriously, and she thinks he's the strongest person she's ever met.</p>
<p>His home is kept well organized, and all his possessions are in their own place and group. He keeps his clothing as neat as possible. Even while fighting, a scratch won't get on his clothing.</p>
<p>He is a hybrid and has inherited cat-like traits such as purring, hissing, claws, tail, and enhanced jumping ability. But he can't glide and his tail isn't very prehensile. He can jump great distances both vertically and horizontally. In general, his reflexes are very fast. He also thinks quickly most of the time, which can lead him to make snap decisions before having all the information. He's defensive in stressful situations and keeps his knives close. He has a low tolerance for pain and failure; even a small scratch will bother him greatly. He only wants to cause as much pain as he thinks is necessary (i.e. for self-defense.) However, he can be vindictive without noticing.</p>
<p>He daydreams about shiny objects, gemstones and their patterns, fabric patterns, and swords. He doesn't have much sense of humor but picks up on jokes fine. Besides his treasure hunting, he isn't sure what he wants most in his life. Or perhaps he is content living in the moment and pursuing small goals.</p>
<p>He wants to project an image of maturity. He has a medium-low voice and speaks quickly. His face is often stern and stoic, but he has a surprisingly big smile. He is about the same size as his dad, slightly taller.</p>
