                                        <p> An idea I've had since Halloween of last year; a Saplant being cut apart and leaking veggie juices. It's a non descript specimen.</p>
                                        <p>I haven't been motivated to draw since school ended, so it was a shock I managed to finish this. I don't usually finish pencil drawings, but I wasn't particularly feeling like doing digital work, so I had fun with my box of 100 Crayola colored pencils. There's a picture with better lighting below, though the light in the first adds to the tone. <a href="/Images/Salad Sketch.jpg">Here is a failed concept skecth.</a></p>
