                                        <p> Fun experimental pictures of one of my species, Megabytes. I was trying to get a dither look for the static one, but dithers don't work very well for drawings. I still think the picture came out cool and somewhat Old Web style.</p> <p> The animated parallax is meant to look like/ be pixel art. The intended effect came out better, but getting them pixelized was harder than I thought it would be simply because of the tools available to me. I used a tool called Agave Art Sweet on Itch.io make everything pixels, screenshot the resulting images in Microsoft Paint to get a better resize, made them transparent in Affinity Photo, then put them in Agave Art Sweet's layer tool. It doesn't make gifs despite being advertised as an animation tool, so I recorded a video, converted it to a gif, then cropped it. And this is the roundabout's result!</p>.</div>
