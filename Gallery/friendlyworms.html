                    <p>Exploring this forest was so much fun for Sig. He had already found so many interesting bugs; slugs, snails, caterpillars, all out after the rain. As he kept walking deeper into the woods, he saw something pink moving on the ground. He thought it must be an earthworm since it had just rained. It appeared again and was much bigger than any he had ever seen. Excitedly he followed its movements until he found a small cave in the dirt. The cave looked like there might have been something inside once, but now it was empty except for some moss and grass.</p>
<p>He climbed up to look inside the cave when suddenly he felt himself being pulled down by a very strong force. That worm he found had him held by the leg. Unsure how to react, he stayed still as it loosened its grip and moved up, then slithered down his pants. Another worm came up from the ground, moving the same way as the other one. Together they pulled Sig's pants down and off with his underwear.</p>
<p>The young boy was confused but enamored with the worms' movements, so he let them continue. When they were finished, he was left standing naked with two giant earthworms crawling all over him. They crawled around his legs, arms, waist, chest, back, and even between his thighs. A third worm joined the first two and began climbing up his stomach and chest toward his face. With each movement of the worm, he could feel the warm wetness spreading through his skin. One decided to enter his mouth, causing him to gag at first, but soon grew accustomed to the taste and texture. It slithered all around his mouth, enjoying how damp it was inside.</p>
<p>Still, more worms emerged from the ground and even the ceiling. They grabbed Sig's arms, lifting him off the ground. A smaller one began to play with his nipple, flicking it up and down. He moaned at the feeling. Another slid across the young boy's crotch, caressing his balls, curling around his growing shaft. Then it moved lower down until it found a small hole. Sig gasped when the earthworm began to dig into him. Slowly it burrowed deep inside, stretching his insides and making his cock harder than ever before. Soon it stopped digging, leaving a bulge that pushed against his belly. More worms continued to emerge from the soil above and below, all of which took turns pleasuring Sig.</p>
<p>Eventually, the earthworms begin to settle down, allowing Sig to breathe normally once more. His head spun and he couldn't believe what was happening to him. So many big earthworms playing with his body, using him however they pleased. But he found he didn't mind it, even enjoyed their exploring. It was a pleasant surprise having bugs be so curious about him too. The earthworms slowly retracted themselves into the ground and disappeared, leaving Sig alone. Feeling drowsy after the experience, he laid down, falling asleep in the cool, damp cave.</p>
                                        <p> [This came to me pretty fast, but took longer than I thought to finish. But it was really fun to experiment with different effects and a dirt background. As previously discussed I gotta make stuff I want to see myself and I want bugs to show their love for Sig. Also, nobody really does much with the Mini/Meg versions of characters from Puyo Puyo 7. Or earthworms in porn.] </p><script src="/Asset/comment.js"></script></div>
