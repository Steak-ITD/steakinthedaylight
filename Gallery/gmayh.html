                                        <p>"Give me all you have."</p>
<p>Held tight by his partner, Lemres had told Sig this when he sensed that familiar surge of power, need, and lust. He saw it in the demon's eyes. He wanted an outlet, and Lemres had let himself be that in the past. It was their little ritual.</p>
<p>It had been a while, though, and so this time, it was much rougher and visceral. Sig barely held back, practiced control going out the window. Scratches and bites soon marred Lemres' skin, deep red leaking from each new laceration. But then his arm stayed caught in Sig's teeth, and instead of a usual bite, there was a rip, and flesh fell into his mouth.</p>
<p>Lemres felt a bit shocked. This was different, more intense. Maybe they had waited too long, and the demon's hunger had grown too voracious. The nawing continued, more skin and muscle torn from his upper arm until bloodied bone remained. And to more bodily shock, it was then grabbed harshly and snapped off, the lower arm falling away.</p>
<p>(Shadowy waves suddenly filled Lemres' mind. Perhaps, if what he had heard was true, then...)</p>
<p>He was distracted from his thoughts by more clawing, now at his belly. Then, another sort of tearing below; his belly was pulled apart, revealing the warm, pinkish insides. The both of them moaned to their suprise. The pain wasn't entirely unwelcome. It was even pleasant, in some sick way.</p>
<p>That feeling was only exacerbated as Sig reached inside the pulsing guts. His hands pushed and pulled, sharp claws cutting into them. Lemres could feel his blood rushing down below, even lower than his ruined intestines. He chuckled internally, seeing his apparent arousal as a bit of levity in the twisted situation.</p>
<p>Sig still wasn't done. He looked at his partner's face; panting and pale. His claws moved up to his neck. Stretched, tight skin. Perfect for shredding. His hesitation has gone by now. He scrathed at it, watching the skin loosen and more blood leak from his arteries. He continued until it sprayed, further staining his shirt. Wet coughing also filled the air. He found it mesmerizing. But it still wasn't enough. His machinations continued all around the neck until finally he reached bone. He couldn't even tell if the man below him was still breathing, with the many muscles torn apart. Still, like before, he continued to hold and pull until he heard a louder snap.</p>
<p>A flash of clarity hit him. Why now, he wasn't sure. But waves of confused disbelief began to overwhelm Sig as he looked over the mangled body of his partner. He lifted the detached head and looked into the still, calm face. He let him do all this, so sure it would be okay. He was thankful and horrified. Tears dot his eyes, and he brings the head closer to kiss his still warm lips. He sobs into them. It will be okay, it will be okay.</p>
<p>Lemres woke up slowly, languidly. He was in a warm bed, crisp spring air coming through the window. As he sat up, he reminded himself of last night's events. His hand rose to his neck; tender, soft, and perhaps loose? But attached.</p>
<p>(Sparks of darkness filled his mind. It seems he had use for his heritage yet.)</p>
<p>The door opened to reveal a tired looking Sig. The two looked at each other, and a small smile crossed Lemres' face. He whispered a "hello.", and Sig rushed over to him.</p>
<p>"I love you," he said, hugging his recovered partner, who replied in kind. "You're really ok...?"</p>
<p>"Magic can work wonders. But how are you? Feeling better?"</p>
<p>"You're worried about me? After all this?"</p>
<p>"I'm always thinking of you," Lemres sighed and kissed Sig's forehead. "But next time, let's not wait so long." They remained there for several minutes, taking in the peaceful silence.</p>
