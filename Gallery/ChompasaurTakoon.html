                                        <p> Welp. This was going to be in a large scale collage. But I never got contacted back, and it seems to have stopped updating, and their emails don't work, sooo.... HERE IT IS HERE. This was made back in February, before I had more colored pencils and acrylic paint markers, so I had to use only the very few I had, and a sharpie marker, which smudges too easily and bleeds through the page... so, the colors are off from these pets' actual pallettes. i'm thinking of remaking this digitally, as I do like how it came out overall. I don't do sequences very often.</p></div>
