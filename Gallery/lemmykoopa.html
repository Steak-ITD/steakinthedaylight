                                        <p> Drew a koopa after such a long time, since I have been getting back into Mario games. Some guy on Youtube briefly mentioned Lemmy being autistic, likely as a joke, but I latched onto the idea. So it's my headcanon now. More: </p>
                                        <p>    Lemmy considers himself a master of trickery and illusion, so he is pretty good at masking.
                                            He stims by waving his tail side to side then up and down exactly 20 times each. He also would have stuff to chew on.
                                            He gets understimulated and bored very easily, and actually prefers a lot of loud noises and motion. 
                                            He enjoys thrills and spectacles, knows a lot about stunts, circus acts, tricks, and magic about illusion and shadows.</p>
