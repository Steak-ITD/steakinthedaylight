                                        <p> I have no idea what to do with digital linework anymore (shading was also a bit weird). I see cool examples on Deviant Art, and try to make something inspired by those, but I can't figure it out... well, I enjoy how this looks anyhow. I really like the Puyo 7 transformations, and it fit well with the poses I bought recently. Below is another sketch I did, which I didn't like enough to finish.</p>
