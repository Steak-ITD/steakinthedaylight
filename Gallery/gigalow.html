                                        <p>This is a species I made up called gigabytes, based on the thing. Since they are basically living data they can be edited in multiple ways, and as such become corrupt and unreadable, glitched, etc. I dunno how sapient they are, I firgure it would depend on what's inside them or even what they were made of. This one is supposed to be a stoplight emulator, until it became broken.</p>.</div>
