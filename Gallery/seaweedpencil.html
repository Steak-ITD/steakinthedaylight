                                        <p> Another persona of mine, previously featured in a color test. They are a non canon Saplant, as those will be based on fruits and vegetables on the surface of earth. She represents my libido and is my attempt at processing such when it becomes bothersome to me. They are a soft, slimy, squishy being, and her genitals tend to vary. As you can see, she/they are interchangable. </p>.</div>
