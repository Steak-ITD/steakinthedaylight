                                        <p> I can't think of a good name for this sketch, oh well. I think these three would have a neat dynamic different from just Lemres and Sig. </p>
                                        <p>With the three of them, I imagine a brotherly dynamic. Lemres is the oldest one, but he's also the most anxious and Sig and Salde like to tease and tempt him. Even though he would have the "caretaking" role they'd both end up, like, double teaming him, he's definitely a sub in this situation. He's not super assertive unless it's really needed. He can be protective at times too, just wants his boys to be safe.</p>

<p>Salde likes being in charge and being pampered, but also likes to reward his partners. Seeing them happy makes him fuzzy inside. He's a bit seductive even. Enticing others with his charm is exciting. He's needy tho, and would be most likely to get jealous.</p>

<p>Sig is patient. He would be a mediator for conflict. He's most sensitive to changes in his partners' demeanor and emotion. He's more on the caring side like Lemres, but enjoys getting to be a bit lazy when Salde rewards him. He's most content just spending silent time with the others, next to a cozy fire or in a warm blanket.</p>
