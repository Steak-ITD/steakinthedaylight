                                        <p> This started as a warmup for the <i>other</i> drawing, but I liked it enough to want to work on it more. A lot more. I haven't done lineless in a while, probably because it's so tedious, but I think it matches my style. I feel like I hesitate too much with how saturated the colors in my work are, so I used more of it. Release your inhibitions, feel the rain on your skin, etc? I also made it like, a VHS screenshot, because I found a good tutorial for it. So I guess, I went overboard with a sketch. Again. I am just so consistent like that.</p></div>
