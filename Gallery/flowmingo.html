                                        <p>Dynamons is not a good game. It's pretty uninspired. The artwork is boring, the animations are boring, the set stages and paths are not fun, especially for a monster RPG. And the monsters, I can't even put into words how I feel. They feel so obvious. And yes some of them DO look like discount Pokemon. I know that's a common insult to these games, but I play many of them. I MEAN IT THIS TIME.</p>
                                        <p>What's the name supposed to be anyway? "Dynamons". Dynamite Monsters? Dynamic Monsters? Dyna-Fire-You-Sick-Monsters?</p>
                                        <p>Anyway, here's one of them laying an egg.</p></div>
