                                        <p> Continuing my trend of drawing human hybrids, I have done a griffon-taur. I think it's even cooler than horses due to the anatomical mixups. This painting also was a bit hard, mainly because of the human skin and trying to shape it out so it has some depth. I am not sure of the strokes needed for that. While the process of digital paint can be enjoyable, the end results are more mixed. I think it's obvious I don't know everything.</p>
