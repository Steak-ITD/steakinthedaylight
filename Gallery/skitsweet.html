                                        <p> A design I had bought from rienadopts again, I decided to try out this rendering method again. I think it looks pretty nice here. I could have even made this lineless if I wanted to, but the linework is part of the method. I'm thinking maybe I could make some lore for this creature, since it has two brains essentially. </p>
