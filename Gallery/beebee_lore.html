                                        <p>Beebee is a female blue feathered duck with red/magenta eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Beebee lives in the universe of Duck Life Adventure. She is the daughter of Marco. She is renowned for her talents in racing and battling.</p>

<p>The curse that was set on her was not meant to be a curse. Her mother wished it to be a protection spell, keeping her safe from danger. But having little experience in magic, it was twisted into something worse. In her botched attempt to protect her daughter she ends up dooming her, but she doesn't realize this for quite a while.</p>

<p>The curse appears as a black-feathered red-eyed duck with Bee's hairstyle. It doesn't show up in the physical world, usually only in her dreams or hallucinations.</p>

<p>She has had many fatal accidents in both battles and training. Very violent accidents, that often leave her disfigured somehow. However, she seems to survive all of these incidents, and recover from them rather quickly. She isn't sure why this only applies to her, as no other duck around gets as badly hurt as she does, and as far as she knows nobody else has straight-up died.</p>

<p>Until one fateful training session on the roller-coaster. She messes up a hole so badly that she ends up crashing with at least 4 other ducks on board, all of who ended up a bloody mess. She is the only one who survives and seeing this freaks her out immensely, having gotten used to this only applying to her. Not knowing what to do anymore, she disappears from the public eye, not wanting to be blamed for the deaths.</p>

<p>It's publicly unknown what happens to her afterward. Nobody else is aware of the curse, so nobody in this town could help her, presumably. She seeks to figure out how to break her curse in isolation, fearing she hurts someone else.</p>

<p>The isolation does drive her madder and madder, missing her races and battles with other ducks, but feeling obligated not to go back and hurt anyone. Her hallucinations get worse, the curse becoming more solid, and she can touch and hear it.</p>

<p>She comes to the conclusion after speaking to the curse that all her deaths were accidents, caused by her slipping up or something else coming to get her (shark). She begins to wonder what happens if she causes the deaths herself. </p>

<p>What ends up happening is that the injuries last. She tears parts of her body off and gets sick with parasitic infections. Even though the injuries last like scars, the pain doesn't, and her senses begin to null. She feels numbness both mentally and physically, and she wonders if this is better or worse than the stress and fear she had before.<br />
By the time Jexity finds her she is a zombie, a walking corpse with hardly any mind left.</p>
