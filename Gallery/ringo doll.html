                                        <p> A cute doll I drew of Ringo in order to test some things, mainly the lab color profile in Krita. Using a lab color profile in a PSD makes it incompatible with everything except Krita... so that limits me to what I can do because certain things I always do are not possible in that program because of how its layers work like how I quickly color lines. The lab color profile does make more vibrant blending though, and this time I didn't use any blender tools and painted all on one layer (using a wet brush) and it turned out nice. I did do the linework in Clip Studio Paint. The vector layer's features are just too useful. </p>
