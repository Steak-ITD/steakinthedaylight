                                        <p>Dollpheno is a monster I've had for a long time. I originally conceived it as a Fakemon, then eventually redesigned it to be just a monster. I wanted to mod it into Monster Crown, but I couldn't figure out how to make my sketches into sprites to fit into the game. So I just colored in the sketches, then pasted them all into one picture, a digitally colored piece made to look like a traditional cut picture.</p>.</div>
