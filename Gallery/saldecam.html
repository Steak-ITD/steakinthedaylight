                                        <p> Because I think of Salde as flirtatious, I though he would be a cam boy in an alternate universe... the kind that teases his viewers a lot by just barely showing things. I really wasn't sure what I was doing with the colors and the linework at all, so it came out pretty sloppy looking, but it fits the amateurish tone a bit. </p>
