                                        <p> A part of my envisioning of a relationship between Sonic and Cream. It's something I think about during art block.. </p>
                                        <blockquote>
<p>So I have been thinking about my own version of sonicream lately (in which cream is a somewhat precocious preteen who is happy to have someone not treat her like a pure untouchable angel and sonic is a guilt-ridden young adult lolicon-in-denial who can't help but love seeing his friend happy) but I can't think of any real solid plot for it so. I will just make it a stream-of-consciousness thing. Don't need to force it. And anyway I already got a lot of other solid plot stuff burning on the air fryer so this could be stress relief in between those.</p>
<p><a title="a sketch of their feelings" href="/Images/Sketches/576128502253150a.jpeg">"Feelings"</a></p>
<p>What if they, in their shared lust, got Cream pregnant? She couldn't hide it from her mother, but she won't say who the dad is. She can't ruin everyone's image of Sonic. He of course knows he's the dad and is mentally panicking.</p>
<p>They both don't say anything to each other once it's announced. Just glance at each other knowingly.</p>
<p>She'll give the baby up for adoption and perhaps someday they'll come back. I haven't gotten that far yet...</p>
