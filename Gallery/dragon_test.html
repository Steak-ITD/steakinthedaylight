                                        <p> Colorization of one of the Dragon Deirdre sketches. I wanted her to look ruffled and a little swampy.</p>
                                        <p>For this picture I tried doing it in greyscale to get an impression of the value differences, as I have seen other artists do in tutorials. But I couldn't figure out how to then get the color on while keeping the established values. The end result makes it feel too tagged on imo. I used a color layer and played around with brightness/contrast corrections.</p>

<p>Another thing is hair. I really can't figure out how to make the strands have a curled, smooth look. And any tutorial I find doesn't really go into enough depth on what kind of strokes to make or their placement. So I was in the dark trying to paint it. Ultimately I kept the pencil lines as I thought what I managed looked better in tandem.</p>
