                                        <p> Something I made to vent after a hard time. I have been doing more colored pencil works lately as most of my digital work has been for Artifimon and Creative Clash for the past August/September. I think I'm getting better with blending the colors, or it's just a bit easier with the softer Prismacolor pencils. Also, I finally drew goat Amitie with goat accurate eyes. Took me long enough I suppose.</p><script src="/Asset/comment.js"></script></div>
