                                        <p> I did something a little different this day, having the subject offscreen (it's Sig) as well as digital painting. The entire thing was made digitally too, which is very daunting to me as I usually make a sketch. I think it turned out very nice. I was worried the forms might not come through but I think they're solid enough to make out, right? </p></div>
