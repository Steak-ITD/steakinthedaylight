                                        <p> Practicing with a new fineliner brush in CSP and my Wacom drawing tablet. Both the linework and colors were done with the tablet. Lines were pretty hard to make in a one and done way so I pretty much gave up on that and did it as if I were using a pencil. Coloring went more smoothly, feeling similar to but easier than paints. I also think I need a better method to quickly color lines, or I'll have to try manually.</p>
