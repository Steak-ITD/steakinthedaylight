                                        <p> I was looking through my old 2021 art, and I came across this one. I thought to myself, "hey this one actually doesn't suck". So here it is! I fell in love with and subsequently drew Minus Mod Pico a lot. It was very weird but it helped me get better with digital art, which I'm very happy about. For this piece in particular I love how I did the lighting. I should take notes...</p>.</div>
