                                        <p> Mainly what I have to say about this was how it was made; with my graphic tablet, and using pencil brushes. I thought the environment would come out a little better, but the positioning of the tablet and the screen is something I still have to get used to. It also makes me struggle with the linework, but that actually didn't come out too bad. It is much easier to color than it is to line with a drawing tablet, which is why I thought painting would be easier than with a mouse. </p></div>
