                                        <p>This is the second time I have drawn Amy. Been in my head for a bit, it feels freeing to have it actually on paper. I intended to color it, but I don't think it would look good with all the erasing I did, and the page is practically smeared with graphite now. I will be coloring it later digitally, eventually.<br>I really like masturbation and exploration as a theme in smut. I think learning about yourself in these ways is also a freeing experience.</p>.</div>
