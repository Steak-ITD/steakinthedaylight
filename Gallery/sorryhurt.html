                                        <p> Sig is a bit dsymorphic about his left arm, so I imagine he questions the use of it. He wasn't always like this. It's disturbing having this weird, red strong arm attached to him. He can ignore it sometimes, but other times it gets to him... he imagines curing it, tearing it off and apart. Sometimes he engages in self injury, though he knows it doesn't help, the thoughts behind it manifest like this. </p>
