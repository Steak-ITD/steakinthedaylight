                        <p>This page contains NSFW material.</p>
                        <h2>ToS:</h2>
                        <p>Please send inquiries to <b>steakinthedaylight[at]proton[dot]me</b>. Payment is taken up front <b>(via PayPal or Venmo, more methods coming soon)</b> after I accept the commission and I won't begin until paid. I will need: the commission type, a description or reference of the character (such as a ref sheet or wiki page with gallery), and details about the kind of scene you want me to draw (pose and background references, # of halfbody/fullbody characters). You can also give me some artistic freedom on aspects you aren't sure about.</p>
                        <p>As the commissioner, you can use the resulting artwork by tracing, referencing, and remixing it for non profit purposes.</p><p>You cannot claim ownership of the artwork or sell it for profit in ways such as printing on posters or t-shirts to sell, NFT usage, or AI training.</p><p>Please do not post my work on websites I am on the DNP of, including E621, furbooru, rule34 paheal or rule 34 xxx. You do not need to credit me if posted to Twitter.<p>You must be 18+ years of age to commission me. I can decline a commission for any reason. Private commissions are accepted and do not incur any extra charge.</p><p>Please ask any questions you may have.</p>
                        <h2>Overview:</h2>
                        <p>I mainly specialize in simple toony creature designs and those based mainly of specific shapes. I can also do backgrounds and abstract art. I can create SFW or NSFW artwork. I'm willing to try most things.</p>
                        <h3>Will draw</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Original or fan characters</li>
                            <li>Toony Humans and Animals</li>

                            <li>Taboo themes such as [ero] guro [nasensu], sholicub, rape/noncon, incest, +more</li>
                            <li>Adult real person fiction, sexual or not</li>
                            <li>Backgrounds (forests, cities, bedrooms)</li>
                            <li>Realism/direct observation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Won't draw</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mouthpieces, positive or not</li>
                            <li>Parody/hateful art</li>
                            <li>Sexual child real person fiction(non sexual ok)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Turnaround time should be between 1-2 weeks, potentially sooner depending on my work schedule. I'm probably going to be open indefinitely, unless I go on vacation or have a long queue. If I feel like something is too complicated for me to draw, I will more likely decline it than charge more, as I want to be able to put my best foot foward.</p>
