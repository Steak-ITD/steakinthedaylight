                                        <p> I've been trying to design a Webcore character, based on old mascots from the 2000's like Deviantart's Fella. It's going ok, there are some elements I had trouble working out, like the shape of its hands. I intend to make him a 3d model someday, and so I switched out having five floating fingers for the sake of being easier to animate. It also has a screen meant to show its expressions, using emoticons/kaomoji and letters. Not sure if it should stretch across his whole head or just be at the front of his face. Its stomach has a window that could open to show information, or even be a portal?</p>
                                      <p>UPDATE 2025: This character has more or less been replaced by <a href="/Images/Edits/buggy.html">Buggy.</a></p></div>
