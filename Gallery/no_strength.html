                                        <p> Everywhere I go, it's always the same. Find "your" people, "your" community. Strength in numbers. Unity is all.

But all I have found throughout my life is pain. Conformity. Suppressed individuality. Peer pressure. Pride in things you didn't choose rather than what you do. Hive minds. Gaslighting. Shame. Superiority.

All accepted. It is such a human thing. It hurts me to be like this. To be this kind. To have this biological need. But I am the only one not happy like this. Everyone around is content in being a social animal. And it's so alienating to me. 

Please let me be me. Please don't let me blend into a meld of shallow identity others call "community". Please let me keep my self worth for myself and not to make others feel good.

I will learn to be lonely if it means I will still be me. I will happily be forgotten to time if it means I will still be me.

There are no search results for "there is no strength in community". I hope this changes that.

While I don't want to form any kind of collective I hope someone else can gain some comfort from this. </p></div>
