                                        <p> I liked the mobile monster game Bulu Monster, which is still up, but seldom played nowadays. It has very cool monster designs and a kind of interesting world, and it does the set path gameplay better than Dynamons, in my opinion. I made a porn of it because that's (usually) how I express my love for things. Though it's not super erotic, I really like how this picture came out. </p>.</div>
