                                        <p> Having become frustrated with how my linework looks, I have decided to create more art without that method, and do more painting. This one, while I like the result, was hard to create due to Wisp Angemon being mostly white. It made shading and lighting color choices difficult. The reason this image is labeled sketch one is because I planned to try different painting styles in Krita, but I grew tired physically. </p>
