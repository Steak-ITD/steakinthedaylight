                                        <p> Hemoglobin is back as a Neutral Normal Chao, wearing a winter coat from Chao World Extended. And here is Sonichao, a Neutral Run Chao. Apparently they just look like Sonic naturally, and Dark Run Chao look like Shadow. Weird, huh? I picked an artic area for them because they both used to be wearing coats until I took Sonichao's off because it looks better without it.</p><p>I finished this, but it didn't really come out the way I imagined, owes to the fact I couldn't find the exact colors I needed. One advantage of digital I suppose. I tried to adjust it to see if I could get the colors closer to my imagination/in game. It kind of worked.
I think I did ok overall, it's just not perfect. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'm actually most proud of the landscape of all things!</p>
