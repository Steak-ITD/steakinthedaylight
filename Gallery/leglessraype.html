                                        <p>The hands are ice cold, and they surrounded and grabbed him from all sides. Choking scratching. Clawing attacking. Does it even matter if he screamed or cried about how much it hurt? He had no clue ehat he did yo deserve this. Maybe nothing at all. Maybe he was just around, and these things needed to be occupied. </p><p>He wished they would have just pulled off his arms already, they were held so tight. Yet not really keeping him still. He bobbed up and down with the hand in his rectum. It oiereced his insides with every hop. If was cold, and it burnt. And it was dull, and it stung. He was sick and strangely he was pleased, he knew it, felt it below, but he also knew he would get no relief himself. That would be to kind, now wouldn't it? It's much crueler to pile dissatisfaction on shame.</p><p>They left as quickly as they came. He didn't really know what or how they had been satisfied. But they were done and gone. He wasn't going to complain or ask anymore questions. Just... lie back in his grave emptyness. Cry as he usually did, this time out of relief and exhaustion. It was a pitiful respite, but one none the less. He had to cherish those moments that weren't pure torture.</p> <p>[Legless Ray from Sonic.exe Mania Abyss... he's cute to me? And different from the others, he seems to be sad about his fate. 
Well.
Clearly he needs to be taught a lesson...?]</p></div>
