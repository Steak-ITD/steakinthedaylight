                                        <p> I've wanted to draw Beydia being ravished by one of the other crownies with tentacles. Sometimes that's the only reason you know. The wiki is down and I only had Sylindra on my computer, so that's who I chose. It was a bit hard with just two tentacles, I hope I didn't make the wrapping one too long. Kiyirin is also there. </p>.</div>
