                                        <p> How can this fandom full of every fetish under the sun not have a picture of Knuckles the egg laying mammal laying eggs? Well it does now. I used a Sai Marker in Clip Studio Paint and it really did come out like linework I used to make in Sai. I also used 20pt size, so it's really chunky. However, with pen pressure, there's a bit too much transparency in the lines, so I had to draw over them a few times. </p>
