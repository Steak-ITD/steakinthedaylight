                                        <p> Yet another image I had started months ago, forgotten about, found the CSP file for and spontaneously decided to finish. It's also another color experiment in which the subject and background are compliments. I also found a use for the divide layer, which I don't really understand yet. it had a very nice effect on the color scheme on top. The bottom is my original vision for this piece.</p>.</div>
