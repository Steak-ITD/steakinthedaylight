                                        <p> My dreams have been getting very vivid lately, but that doesn't mean I remember all of it, unfortunately... I drew this based on a scene from one of them. It's very loose and unrefined. I did very little touchup with this, like, I probably would have drawn Ray's body a bit different. But doing it this way really gave it a fading, dream like feeling. </p>.</div>
