                                        <p> I've been off and on into sonic horror games, even though I feel like they get into periods of repetitiveness. If I had the talent to make one of these, my story would involve Tails and Amy misusing the occult/summoning demons, having one posses Amy turning her into a spectre that takes control of Hill Top Zone. Blowing up the volcano. Then Tails would travel up the mountain to defeat her before it's too late. It'd have some platforming in it and of course a boss fight in the style of the Genesis games. I think it'd be fun but alas, I'm not good at pixel art nor do I want to buy the engine these games are made in. </p>
                                        <p> Still, I conceptualized a spooky looking Amy Rose for this hypothetical game. It took a while as I don't think my style lends itself to creepiness well. But eventually I came across something that I thing works as a uncanny distruption of her design.</p>
