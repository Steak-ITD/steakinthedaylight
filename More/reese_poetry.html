  <section>
  <p>Reese Puffs, great food/ peanut butter chocolate/ the best of breakfast</p>
	  <p> Eat it every day/ the sweet combo of flavors/ just makes my morning</p>
	  <p>candy and sugar/ Not good for your dental health/ but good for tastebuds</p>
	  <p>oh no there is much/ bought too many at the store/ time for halloween</p>
	  <p>they all vanish first/ everybody loves these things/ but no more for me</p>
	  <p>have to get more of/ my favorite combo sweet treat/ let's go to the store</p>
	  <p>sold out they tell me/it's a very loved candy/ bought all on day one</p>
	  <p>now what do i do/ distressed over the loss of/ my sweet confection</p>
	  <p>i can't recover/ from this horrible shortage/ oh wait some skittles</p>
	  <p>Nevermind! :P</p>
