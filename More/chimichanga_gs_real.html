	<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">"We find cool and real new Pok&#233;mon I swear"</h2>
	<h3 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">12/18/2000-NEW Pok&#233;mon DISCOVERED IN GS!!!</h3>
	<p style="background-color:SlateBlue;">A cool new Pok&#233;mon was just discovered in the new Gold and Silver games! It's an extremely rare and powerful Pok&#233;mon that isn't available in game normally.</p>
	<img src="/More/c12058_0239b7bc48b74dc9a7f979c2e424f31b~mv2.png" alt="HTML"> <i style="color:orange;">OFFICIAL ART OF CHIMICHANGA LEAKED</i>
	<p style="background-color:SlateBlue;">CHIMICHANGA has the makings of an utterly incredible monster. It looks like Chikorita but is NOT CHIKORITA. It is orange, has a rose, long claws, and a mace tail. It has the base stat total 700, can learn all the moves in the game including the brand new move, "Leaf Infused Explosion" with base power 100! CHIMICHANGA does not evolve because it is already perfect.</p>

	<h4 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">HOW TO GET CHIMICHANGA EASY METHOD</h4>
	<p style="background-color:SlateBlue;">You have to use Gameshark on your Game Boy Color, remember to switch on the Game Boy Color when you use it</p>
<p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">9266FA6C97BD W654HT28HBVW 1KRHE57HY1WR 23TYUPIVOIST U15TJD5632FR WE4RT6YIOPS2</p>
	<p style="background-color:SlateBlue;">Insert all of these codes in this specific order before you make a new file or they will not work</p>
	<ol>
	<li style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Step 1: Start the game, name your trainer Chef</li>
	<li style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Step 2: Pick a starter but DO NOT PICK CHIKORITA or it will not work!</li>
	<li style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Step 3: Don't evolve your starter Pok&#233;mon or train it, it has to be level 5 the whole game.</li>
	<li style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Step 4: Finish the whole game including all 16 gyms defeated. Beat the Elite Four at least 77 times if you chose Cyndaquil or 79 if you chose Totodile</li>
	<li style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Step 5: Make sure you catch all 251 Pok&#233;mon in the game of course but DO NOT CATCH CHIKORITA (you still need Bayleef and Meganium though)</li>
	<li style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Step 6: After catching all the Pok&#233;mon you have to defeat Trainer Red on Mt Silver at least 155 times with Cyndaquil in your party, or 158 times with Totodile. MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN THE PARTY OR YOU WILL HAVE TO START OVER.</li>
	<li style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Step 7: After the last battle, you have to go back up Mt. Silver and this time Red should not be there, if he still is you messed it up. If he is not then everything is done properly. But when you go check be sure that you ONLY have Cyndaquil or Totodile in your party and make sure they are level 5, no higher.</li>
	<li style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Step 8: Stand in the spot that Red was in, save and turn off the game, then turn it back on (make sure the Gameshark is on too)</li>
	<li style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Step 9: The CHIMICHANGA will appear in front of you and see if you are worthy. I don't know how to tell if you are worthy but if you aren't then sorry you have to start all over again.</li>
	</ol>

	<i style="color:orange;">CHIMICHANGA IN GAME!!!</i>
	<p style="background-color:SlateBlue;">If you are worthy then you will battle the CHIMICHANGA and be able to catch it! It says Chikorita because the game replaced it with CHIMICHANGA but forgot to change just the name, everything else is changed</p>
	<img src="/More/Spr_2s_152.png" alt="HTML"> <i style="color:orange;">Official CHIMICHANGA Sprite in Silver!</i>
	<p style="background-color:SlateBlue;">That is how you catch the CHIMICHANGA! It is really hard but real so if you can't get it then you just messed up sorry</p>
