		<br>The Wild Banana may seem like a weird fruit.</p>
    <p>It is small and wide. It is mostly green and has tons of seeds inside.</p>

		Wild Banana came first. Humans domesticated and created Sweet Banana. Sweet Banana is longer and thinner, mostly yellow, and only has 1 seed at the bottom. Maybe Sweet Banana is the more strange one.</p>
    <p>Wild Banana is pretty different from Sweet Banana, and so it's not very popular. Sweet Banana can be eaten with desserts, like ice cream and cake. It's baked into bread too. Wild Banana, however, is much more bitter. Many people eat it, and never do again because of the taste. Wild Banana doesn't have many dishes to itself.</p>

		<br>Sweet Banana is so popular, that all the other Bananas wanted to be just like it. So they copied Sweet Banana. They copied the looks, the taste, the texture. Soon, every Banana was Sweet Banana. They were indistinguishable. All the same. Peas in a pod, except actually bananas in a tree. Sweet Banana was not only the ideal, but the absolute standard. Any other Banana was inferior.</p>
    <p>Poor Wild Banana... they are so different from Sweet Banana that people don't respect them. They get shunned even. Why so bitter? Why all these seeds? </p>

		<br>Wild Banana didn't really like acting like Sweet Banana. It just didn't suit them. They did not hate Sweet Banana, they just simply could not be them. Wild Banana just wanted to be liked for being themself. They want someone to relate to. Maybe they aren't the only wild fruit. </p>

		<br>There are other wild fruits out there, also not quite in favor. But they are still themselves. They are who they are, and that's nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
